### Recent Development Activity
Recent commits show active development on agent capabilities and PM system enhancements:

1. `9b1acb2` - Enhance agent capabilities by adding new tools
2. `2da7211` - Add epic-start command and branch operations documentation  
3. `dc4a84d` - Merge branch 'main' of github.com:ranaroussi/ccpm
4. `b256251` - Update command files to make preflight checks less verbose
5. `4b47e01` - Fix epic-show.sh script to remove unnecessary error suppression

### Completed Work

#### System Architecture
- Complete Claude Code PM system implementation
- Sophisticated agent coordination system with 4 specialized agents
- Comprehensive command system (40+ PM commands)
- GitHub Issues integration with gh-sub-issue extension
- Git worktree parallel execution framework

#### Documentation
- Complete README.md with workflow documentation
- AGENTS.md documenting specialized agent system
- COMMANDS.md with complete command reference
- Updated CLAUDE.md with project-specific context

#### Core Components
- Project management workflow scripts in `.claude/scripts/pm/`
