# Product Context

## Product Definition

**Claude Code Project Management (CCPM)** is a sophisticated project management workflow system designed to transform Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into shipped code through GitHub Issues integration and parallel AI agent execution.

### Core Value Proposition
Stop losing context. Stop blocking on tasks. Stop shipping bugs. CCPM turns PRDs into epics, epics into GitHub issues, and issues into production code – with full traceability at every step.

## Target Users

### Primary Personas

#### 1. Solo AI-Assisted Developers
- **Profile**: Individual developers using Claude Code for significant projects
- **Pain Points**: Context loss between sessions, serial task execution, "vibe coding"
- **CCPM Solution**: Persistent context, parallel agent execution, spec-driven development
- **Usage Pattern**: Complete workflow from PRD creation to code delivery

#### 2. Small Development Teams (2-5 members)
- **Profile**: Startups and small teams mixing human and AI development
- **Pain Points**: Team coordination, AI work visibility, human-AI handoffs
- **CCPM Solution**: GitHub Issues for transparency, clear audit trails, seamless handoffs  
- **Usage Pattern**: Collaborative workflow with both human and AI contributors

#### 3. Technical Product Managers
- **Profile**: PMs who write specs and coordinate technical implementation
- **Pain Points**: Requirements drift, implementation visibility, progress tracking
- **CCPM Solution**: PRD-to-code traceability, transparent progress, GitHub integration
- **Usage Pattern**: PRD creation, epic oversight, progress monitoring

### Secondary Personas

#### 4. Engineering Managers
- **Profile**: Managers overseeing AI-assisted development teams
- **Pain Points**: Understanding AI progress, ensuring code quality, team coordination
- **CCPM Solution**: GitHub Issues dashboard, audit trails, structured workflows
- **Usage Pattern**: Progress monitoring, quality oversight, team coordination

#### 5. Distributed Teams
- **Profile**: Remote teams using AI assistance for development
- **Pain Points**: Async coordination, context sharing, progress visibility
- **CCPM Solution**: GitHub native integration, persistent context, clear communication
- **Usage Pattern**: Async collaboration with AI agents as team members

## Core Functionality

### User Stories

#### Story 1: Feature Development
**As a** developer using Claude Code  
**I want** to implement a complex feature with multiple components  
**So that** I can work on different parts simultaneously without losing context  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Can create comprehensive PRD through guided brainstorming
- Can break feature into parallel workstreams  
- Can track progress across all components
- Can maintain context between sessions

#### Story 2: Team Collaboration
**As a** team lead  
**I want** to see what AI agents are working on  
**So that** I can coordinate with AI work and hand off tasks seamlessly  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All AI work visible in GitHub Issues
- Progress updates posted as comments
- Clear handoff points between human and AI work
- Audit trail from requirement to implementation

#### Story 3: Requirement Traceability
**As a** product manager  
**I want** every code change to trace back to a business requirement  
**So that** I can ensure we're building the right features correctly  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Complete traceability: Code → Task → Epic → PRD
- No "vibe coding" - every change has justification
- Business requirements drive technical decisions
- Change impact analysis possible

#### Story 4: Parallel Development
**As a** developer  
**I want** to work on multiple parts of a feature simultaneously  
**So that** I can deliver features faster without blocking dependencies  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Multiple AI agents work on same issue
- Parallel workstreams in isolated environments
- Automatic coordination and conflict resolution
- Faster delivery than serial development

## Use Cases
