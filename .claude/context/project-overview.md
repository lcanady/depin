# Project Overview

## System Overview

Claude Code Project Management (CCPM) is a battle-tested project management system that transforms the way AI-assisted development works. Instead of single-threaded conversations that lose context and block on dependencies, CCPM orchestrates multiple AI agents working in parallel with complete traceability from business requirements to production code.

## Core Features

### 1. Spec-Driven Development Workflow
**Feature**: Complete PRD-to-code traceability system
- **PRD Creation**: Guided brainstorming creates comprehensive specifications
- **Epic Planning**: Technical implementation plans with architecture decisions
- **Task Decomposition**: Actionable tasks with acceptance criteria
- **GitHub Synchronization**: Issues become the single source of truth
- **Code Delivery**: Every commit links back to specific requirements

### 2. Parallel Agent Execution System  
**Feature**: Multiple AI agents work simultaneously on complex features
- **Agent Specialization**: Different agents for database, API, UI, and testing work
- **Context Isolation**: Agents prevent context pollution in main conversation
- **Worktree Management**: Parallel development in isolated git environments
- **Coordination**: Agents work together without conflicts
- **Performance**: 5-8x faster delivery through parallel execution

### 3. Context Preservation Framework
**Feature**: Never lose project state between sessions
- **Project Context**: Comprehensive documentation of project state
- **Agent Memory**: Specialized agents maintain focused context
- **Session Continuity**: Load complete project context in new conversations
- **Knowledge Management**: Persistent project knowledge across team members
- **Onboarding**: New team members get full context immediately

### 4. GitHub Native Integration
**Feature**: Seamless team collaboration through GitHub Issues
- **Issues as Database**: All project state stored in GitHub Issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Updates posted automatically as issue comments  
- **Team Visibility**: Human developers see AI progress in real-time
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of decisions and implementations
- **Handoff Support**: Seamless transitions between human and AI work

### 5. Comprehensive Command System
**Feature**: 40+ specialized commands for all PM operations
- **Project Management**: Complete epic and issue lifecycle management
- **Context Operations**: Create, update, and load project context  
- **Testing Integration**: Automated test execution and analysis
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation and integrity checking
- **Workflow Automation**: Status reporting and progress tracking

## Current Capabilities

### Implemented Features

#### Project Management Commands (`/pm:*`)
- **PRD Management**: Create, edit, parse, and track Product Requirements Documents
- **Epic Operations**: Decompose, sync, show, and manage technical implementation plans  
- **Issue Workflow**: Start, sync, close, and coordinate work on specific issues
