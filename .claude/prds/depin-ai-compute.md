# DePIN AI Compute Marketplace

## Executive Summary

A token-incentivized DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) that creates a marketplace for distributed AI compute, allowing users to access or contribute resources for running open-source models. This system democratizes AI compute access while rewarding participants for contributing their computational resources.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
- **High AI Compute Costs**: Centralized cloud providers charge premium rates for GPU compute
- **Limited Access**: Many users and developers cannot access powerful AI infrastructure
- **Resource Waste**: Idle GPUs and compute resources sit unused globally
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependence on major cloud providers limits innovation
- **Geographic Barriers**: Compute resources concentrated in specific regions

### Target Users
- **AI Developers**: Need cost-effective access to GPU compute for model training/inference
- **Resource Providers**: GPU owners wanting to monetize idle compute capacity
- **Enterprises**: Organizations seeking distributed, cost-effective AI infrastructure
- **Researchers**: Academic institutions requiring affordable compute for research

## User Stories

### As an AI Developer
- I want to access distributed GPU compute at lower costs than centralized providers
- I want to run open-source models without infrastructure management overhead
- I want to scale compute resources up/down based on demand
- I want transparent pricing and performance metrics

### As a Resource Provider
- I want to monetize my idle GPU resources when not in use
- I want to earn tokens based on compute contribution and quality
- I want automated resource management without manual intervention
- I want protection against malicious workloads

### As an Enterprise User
- I want reliable, distributed compute infrastructure for AI workloads
- I want cost predictability and competitive pricing
- I want data security and privacy guarantees
- I want SLA guarantees for production workloads
