# Task 005: Resource Health Monitoring and Metrics

## Description

Build a comprehensive real-time resource monitoring system that tracks GPU health, performance metrics, and failure detection across all registered providers. This system will provide continuous visibility into resource status, enabling proactive maintenance and optimal resource allocation decisions through detailed performance metrics collection and analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real-time health monitoring for all registered GPU resources
- [ ] Performance metrics collection (utilization, temperature, memory usage)
- [ ] Automated failure detection and alerting system
- [ ] Health check endpoints for each registered provider
- [ ] Metrics dashboard for resource visibility and analysis
- [ ] Historical performance data storage and trending
- [ ] Threshold-based alerting for resource degradation
- [ ] Integration with provider heartbeat mechanism
- [ ] Resource status API for external system integration
- [ ] Automated recovery procedures for transient failures

## Technical Details

### Components to Implement
- **Health Monitoring Service**: Continuous monitoring of GPU resources
- **Metrics Collection Engine**: Gathers performance data from all providers
- **Failure Detection System**: Automated detection of resource issues
- **Alerting Service**: Notifications for health status changes
- **Metrics Storage**: Time-series database for historical data

### Key Technologies
- Prometheus for metrics collection and storage
- Grafana for monitoring dashboards
- AlertManager for notification routing
- NVIDIA System Management Interface for GPU metrics
- Time-series database for historical analysis

### Integration Points
- Resource registry from Task 004 for monitoring targets
- Allocation system (Task 006) for resource availability updates
- Provider APIs for direct health status queries

## Dependencies

- **Task 004**: GPU Resource Discovery and Registration - Required for knowing which resources to monitor

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: M (Medium - 2-3 days)

**Breakdown**:
- Health monitoring service implementation: 1 day
- Metrics collection and storage: 1 day
- Failure detection and alerting: 0.5 days
- Dashboard and visualization: 0.5 days

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed and verified
- [ ] Unit tests implemented with >85% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate monitoring across multiple providers
- [ ] Load tests demonstrate system can handle monitoring at scale
- [ ] Documentation includes monitoring setup and alert configuration
- [ ] Security review completed for metrics data access
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured for the monitoring system itself
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for metrics collection overhead
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment with sample providers monitored
