# Issue #10 Analysis: Container Runtime and Registry Setup

## Parallel Work Stream Decomposition

This container runtime and registry setup task can be decomposed into 4 parallel streams that can work simultaneously on different aspects of the container infrastructure:

### Stream A: Container Runtime Optimization
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `infrastructure/runtime/`, `config/containerd/`, `scripts/runtime-setup/`
**Dependencies**: Task 001 (Kubernetes cluster operational)
**Work**:
- Configure containerd/Docker with GPU support for AI workloads
- Optimize runtime settings for memory and CPU intensive tasks
- Set up container resource limits and quality of service
- Configure runtime security policies (seccomp, AppArmor)
- Performance tuning for AI/ML container workloads
- GPU passthrough and NVIDIA container runtime setup

### Stream B: Private Registry Deployment
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `infrastructure/registry/`, `config/harbor/`, `deployments/registry/`
**Dependencies**: Task 001 (Kubernetes cluster operational)
**Work**:
- Deploy Harbor enterprise registry solution
- Configure high availability and persistent storage
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates for secure access
- Implement registry replication for disaster recovery
- Configure backup and restore procedures
- Network policies and service exposure

### Stream C: Security & Scanning Pipeline
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `security/scanning/`, `config/trivy/`, `policies/security/`
**Dependencies**: Stream B (needs registry deployment)
**Work**:
- Deploy Trivy/Clair for vulnerability scanning
- Configure automated scanning on image push
- Set up policy enforcement to block vulnerable images
- Implement image signing and verification workflows
- Create security policy templates and rules
- Configure webhook notifications for security events

### Stream D: Authentication & Integration
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `auth/registry/`, `config/auth/`, `scripts/integration-tests/`
**Dependencies**: Stream B (needs registry deployment)
**Work**:
- Configure OIDC/LDAP integration for user authentication
- Set up project-based access control and RBAC
- Implement service account authentication for automated systems
- Create Kubernetes integration for image pulls
- Performance benchmarking and testing
- Integration tests for container deployment workflows

## Execution Strategy

**Phase 1 (Immediate)**:
- Stream A: Container Runtime Optimization
- Stream B: Private Registry Deployment

**Phase 2 (After Stream B)**:
- Stream C: Security & Scanning Pipeline
- Stream D: Authentication & Integration

## Coordination Points

1. **Stream B → Streams C & D**: Registry must be operational before security scanning and auth can be configured
2. **Stream A → Stream D**: Runtime optimization affects integration testing
3. **Streams B & C → Stream D**: Authentication system needs registry and security policies
4. **All Streams → Final Integration**: Complete container infrastructure validation

## Success Criteria

- Container runtime optimized for AI/ML workloads with GPU support
- Private registry operational with SSL/TLS encryption and high availability
- Automated image vulnerability scanning and policy enforcement active
- Authentication and authorization working with RBAC
- Registry backup and disaster recovery procedures tested
- Performance benchmarks demonstrate runtime optimization
- All configurations documented and version controlled
- Integration tests pass for end-to-end container deployment workflows
