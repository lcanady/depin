# Execution Status: DePIN AI Compute

## Ready to Start (4 issues)

- #16: Smart Contract Development for Token Operations (parallel: true) 
- #25: Documentation and API Reference (parallel: true)
- #3: Authentication and Authorization System (parallel: true)

## Next Wave (after dependencies complete)
- #10: Container Runtime and Registry Setup → depends on #6
- #11: IPFS Network Integration → depends on #6  
- #14: Prometheus/Grafana Monitoring Stack Setup → depends on #6
- #15: GPU Resource Discovery and Registration → depends on #6
- #17: Payment Engine and Transaction Processing → depends on #16
- #8: Web3 Wallet Integration and Authentication UI → depends on #3

## Active Agents
{Will be populated when agents start}

## Completed
{None yet}

## Execution Strategy
Starting with 4 parallel streams for ready issues:
1. Infrastructure foundation (#6) - Critical path, must complete first
2. Smart contracts (#16) - Independent blockchain development
3. Documentation (#25) - Can proceed in parallel
4. Authentication system (#3) - Core security foundation

## Dependency Chain
#6 → [#10, #11, #14, #15] → [#2, #18] → [#21, #19] → [#9, #22] → [#12, #23] → [#13, #24, #4, #5, #7]
#16 → #17 → [#20, #5, #7]  
#3 → [#8, #4, #23]
