# Task 009: Load Balancing and Auto-scaling

## Description

Build a dynamic load balancing system with auto-scaling capabilities based on demand and geographic distribution optimization. This system ensures optimal resource utilization and performance across the compute network through intelligent traffic distribution and capacity management.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dynamic load balancing distributes workloads across available compute nodes
- [ ] Auto-scaling system adds/removes capacity based on demand patterns
- [ ] Geographic distribution optimization minimizes latency and network costs
- [ ] Load balancing algorithms handle various workload types and patterns
- [ ] Auto-scaling prevents both resource waste and capacity shortages
- [ ] System maintains performance during traffic spikes and demand changes
- [ ] Cost optimization through intelligent scaling decisions

## Technical Details

### Dynamic Load Balancing
- Implement multiple load balancing algorithms (round-robin, least-connections, weighted)
- Support health-check based routing and automatic failover
- Handle session affinity and stateful workload requirements
- Provide real-time load distribution metrics and monitoring

### Auto-scaling Engine
- Implement predictive scaling based on historical patterns and metrics
- Support horizontal scaling (adding/removing nodes) and vertical scaling (resource adjustment)
- Handle scaling policies and cooldown periods to prevent thrashing
- Integration with capacity management for informed scaling decisions

### Geographic Distribution
- Implement geo-aware load balancing for latency optimization
- Support multi-region workload distribution and failover
- Optimize for network costs and data locality requirements
- Handle regulatory and compliance constraints for data placement

## Dependencies

- **Task 008**: Workload Matching and Placement (needed for placement optimization foundation)

## Effort Estimate

**M (2-3 days)**
- Load balancing algorithms and traffic distribution logic
- Auto-scaling policies and prediction mechanisms
- Geographic optimization and multi-region coordination
- Integration testing across distributed environments

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Load balancing effectively distributes workloads across compute nodes
- [ ] Auto-scaling maintains optimal capacity based on demand
- [ ] Geographic distribution minimizes latency and costs
- [ ] System handles traffic spikes without performance degradation
- [ ] Scaling decisions optimize for both performance and cost
- [ ] All load balancing and scaling logic thoroughly tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks demonstrate optimization effectiveness
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting cover all scaling and balancing metrics
