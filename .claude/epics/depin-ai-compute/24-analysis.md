# Issue #24 Analysis: CI/CD Pipeline and Infrastructure Automation

## Work Streams

### Stream A: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Foundation
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** Immediately
**Files:** .github/workflows/*, .github/actions/*, scripts/ci/*
**Scope:** 
- Set up core GitHub Actions workflows (CI, test, lint)
- Configure automated test execution triggers
- Implement code quality checks and linting
- Basic dependency audit automation
- PR validation workflows

### Stream B: Infrastructure as Code and Environment Provisioning
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** Immediately
**Files:** infrastructure/*, terraform/*, cloudformation/*, scripts/provision/*
**Scope:**
- Create Terraform/CloudFormation templates
- Multi-environment configuration (dev, staging, prod)
- Resource scaling and auto-scaling setup
- Environment provisioning automation
- Backup and disaster recovery infrastructure

### Stream C: Container Orchestration and Service Management
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** Immediately  
**Files:** docker/*, k8s/*, helm/*, compose/*, deployment/*
**Scope:**
- Docker containerization and multi-stage builds
- Kubernetes manifests and service configurations
- Helm charts for package management
- Service mesh and load balancing setup
- Health checks and service discovery

### Stream D: Security Integration and Vulnerability Management
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** After Stream A foundation
**Files:** .github/workflows/security.yml, security/*, scripts/security/*
**Scope:**
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Dependency security audit automation
- Secrets management and rotation
- Access control and audit logging
- Security policy enforcement

### Stream E: Advanced Deployment Strategies and Monitoring
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** After Stream B + C infrastructure
**Files:** deployment/strategies/*, monitoring/*, scripts/deploy/*, rollback/*
**Scope:**
- Blue-green and canary deployment configurations
- Database migration automation
- Comprehensive health monitoring setup
- Automated rollback procedures
- Alerting and operational dashboards

## Dependencies

### Hard Dependencies
- **Stream D** depends on **Stream A**: Security workflows need CI foundation
- **Stream E** depends on **Stream B + C**: Deployment strategies need infrastructure and containers

### Soft Dependencies  
- Stream C benefits from Stream B's networking configs
- Stream D can enhance Stream C's container security
- Stream E integrates monitoring from all other streams

## Coordination Points

### Stream A → Stream D Integration
- Stream A establishes workflow structure and secrets management
- Stream D extends these workflows with security scanning steps
- Shared GitHub Actions and reusable workflow components

### Stream B + C → Stream E Integration
- Stream B provides infrastructure targets and environment configs
- Stream C provides container services and orchestration
- Stream E combines both for deployment automation and monitoring

### Cross-Stream Coordination
- All streams contribute configuration to central deployment manifests
- Shared secrets management between A and D
- Common monitoring endpoints defined across B, C, and E

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Immediate Start (Day 1)
- **Stream A**: Basic CI/CD workflows and test automation
- **Stream B**: Core infrastructure templates and environment setup
- **Stream C**: Container definitions and basic orchestration

### Phase 2 Start (Day 2)
- **Stream D**: Security integration (after Stream A foundation)
- Continue A, B, C with advanced features

### Phase 3 Start (Day 3)
- **Stream E**: Advanced deployment strategies (after B+C infrastructure)
- Integration testing across all streams

### Final Integration (Day 4)
- Cross-stream testing and validation
- End-to-end deployment pipeline testing
- Documentation and operational procedures

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- Infrastructure template conflicts → Stream B owns master templates
- Container orchestration complexity → Stream C focuses on production-ready configs
- Security integration delays → Stream D has fallback to basic security

### Coordination Risks
- Merge conflicts → Separate directory structures by stream
- Integration complexity → Regular sync points between dependent streams
- Timeline dependencies → Buffer time built into dependent stream schedules
