# Task 008: Workload Matching and Placement

## Description

Implement sophisticated resource-to-job matching algorithms and constraint-based placement engine with failover and rescheduling logic. This system ensures optimal job placement on compute nodes based on resource requirements, constraints, and availability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Resource matching algorithms pair jobs with suitable compute nodes
- [ ] Constraint-based placement engine handles complex requirements (GPU type, memory, location)
- [ ] Failover mechanisms automatically reschedule jobs when nodes fail
- [ ] Rescheduling logic handles node capacity changes and job priority updates
- [ ] Placement decisions optimize for performance, cost, and reliability
- [ ] Support for affinity and anti-affinity rules
- [ ] Real-time placement optimization based on changing conditions

## Technical Details

### Resource Matching Engine
- Implement multi-dimensional resource matching (CPU, memory, GPU, storage, bandwidth)
- Support hardware-specific requirements (GPU models, CPU architectures)
- Handle soft and hard constraints with scoring algorithms
- Provide placement recommendation with confidence scores

### Constraint-Based Placement
- Support location constraints (geographic, regulatory, latency requirements)
- Implement resource affinity and anti-affinity rules
- Handle security zones and isolation requirements
- Support custom constraint plugins for extensibility

### Failover and Rescheduling
- Automatic job migration when nodes become unavailable
- Intelligent rescheduling based on historical performance data
- Support for graceful job migration and checkpointing
- Handle partial failures and resource degradation scenarios

## Dependencies

- **Task 006**: Capacity Management and Monitoring (needed for resource availability data)
- **Task 007**: Job Queue and Scheduling Engine (needed for scheduler integration)

## Effort Estimate

**L (3-4 days)**
- Complex matching algorithms and constraint solving
- Sophisticated placement optimization logic
- Robust failover and rescheduling mechanisms
- Integration with multiple system components

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Resource matching accurately pairs jobs with suitable nodes
- [ ] Constraint-based placement handles all requirement types
- [ ] Failover mechanisms maintain job continuity during node failures
- [ ] Rescheduling logic optimizes placement based on changing conditions
- [ ] Placement decisions measurably improve resource utilization
- [ ] All matching and placement algorithms thoroughly tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks demonstrate optimization effectiveness
- [ ] Documentation covers constraint configuration and placement policies
