# Issue #9 Analysis: Job Queue and Scheduling Engine

## Work Streams

### Stream A: Job Queue Infrastructure
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** Immediately
**Files:** services/queue/*, models/job.py, database/migrations/job_queue.py, config/queue.yaml, api/queue.py
**Scope:**
- Persistent job queue with Redis/database backend
- Job submission API and data models
- Job priority handling (high, normal, low) and deadline scheduling
- Job dependencies and batch job processing
- Queue metrics and monitoring endpoints
- Rate limiting and backpressure handling

### Stream B: Scheduling Algorithms
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** Immediately  
**Files:** services/scheduler/*, algorithms/*, schedulers/priority.py, schedulers/roundrobin.py, schedulers/fairshare.py, config/scheduler.yaml
**Scope:**
- Round-robin, priority-based, and fair-share scheduling algorithms
- Resource-aware scheduling (CPU, memory, GPU requirements)
- Job preemption and resource reclamation logic
- Scheduling policy configuration system
- Algorithm selection and switching logic

### Stream C: Workload Distribution Engine
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** After Stream A (depends on job models)
**Files:** services/distribution/*, engines/placement.py, distribution/geographic.py, distribution/topology.py, recovery/reschedule.py
**Scope:**
- Load-aware job distribution across compute nodes
- Geographic and network topology-aware placement algorithms
- Node failure detection and job rescheduling
- Resource utilization optimization
- Job completion time optimization strategies

### Stream D: Queue Persistence & Recovery
**Agent:** general-purpose
**Can Start:** After Stream A (depends on queue infrastructure)
**Files:** services/persistence/*, recovery/*, backup/queue_state.py, monitoring/queue_health.py
**Scope:**
- Queue persistence mechanisms for system reliability
- Disaster recovery and state restoration
- Queue health monitoring and alerting
- Backup and restore operations for job state
- System reliability and graceful failure handling

## Dependencies

### Critical Path
- **Stream A** → **Stream C**: Distribution engine needs job models and queue API
- **Stream A** → **Stream D**: Persistence needs queue infrastructure to protect

### Parallel Execution
- **Stream A & B**: Can run completely in parallel (independent algorithms and infrastructure)
- **Stream C**: Starts after Stream A establishes job models
- **Stream D**: Starts after Stream A establishes core queue system

### Integration Dependencies
- Stream B provides scheduling interfaces that Stream C must integrate with
- Stream C depends on node discovery from Task 002/004 dependencies
- Stream D monitors all systems built by A, B, and C

## Coordination Points

### Data Models (Stream A → All)
- `Job` model with resource requirements, priorities, dependencies
- Queue state representation and serialization
- Job lifecycle status definitions

### Scheduling Interface (Stream B → C)
- Scheduler plugin architecture for algorithm selection
- Resource requirement matching protocols
- Job placement decision API

### Monitoring Integration (Stream D ← All)
- Health check endpoints from all services
- Metrics collection from queue, scheduler, and distributor
- Event streaming for job lifecycle tracking

## Recommended Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Immediate Start)
- **Stream A**: Job Queue Infrastructure
- **Stream B**: Scheduling Algorithms

### Phase 2 (After Stream A Core Complete)
- **Stream C**: Workload Distribution Engine
- **Stream D**: Queue Persistence & Recovery

### Phase 3 (Integration)
- Cross-stream integration testing
- End-to-end job lifecycle validation
- Performance optimization and tuning
