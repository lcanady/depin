# Issue #2 Analysis: Workload Isolation and Sandboxing

## Parallel Work Stream Decomposition

This workload isolation and sandboxing task can be decomposed into 4 parallel streams that can work simultaneously on different aspects of the container security infrastructure:

### Stream A: Container Security Runtime
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `infrastructure/security/runtime/`, `config/gvisor/`, `config/kata/`, `policies/seccomp/`
**Dependencies**: Task 010 (Container Runtime and Orchestration - completed)
**Work**:
- Deploy and configure gVisor or Kata Containers for enhanced isolation
- Implement seccomp profiles to restrict system calls per workload type
- Set up AppArmor/SELinux mandatory access controls and profiles
- Configure user namespace mapping for privilege separation
- Optimize secure runtime performance for AI workloads
- Create runtime security policy templates for different workload classes

**Start Status**: Can start immediately (dependency completed)

### Stream B: Resource Isolation & Control
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `infrastructure/isolation/resources/`, `config/cgroups/`, `policies/resource-limits/`
**Dependencies**: Task 010 (Container Runtime and Orchestration - completed)
**Work**:
- Configure cgroups v2 for precise resource control and accounting
- Implement CPU and memory quotas with fair scheduling policies
- Set up disk I/O throttling and quota enforcement mechanisms
- Configure network bandwidth limiting and Quality of Service (QoS)
- Implement resource monitoring and alerting for quota violations
- Create resource profile templates for different AI workload types

**Start Status**: Can start immediately (dependency completed)

### Stream C: Network Segmentation & Sandboxing
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `infrastructure/network/segmentation/`, `config/calico/`, `policies/network/`
**Dependencies**: Stream B (resource controls needed for network QoS), Task 010 (Container Runtime)
**Work**:
- Create isolated network namespaces per workload with proper routing
- Implement micro-segmentation using Calico or similar CNI network policies
- Set up egress filtering to control and monitor outbound connections
- Configure DNS isolation and filtering with allowlist/blocklist policies
- Implement network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection
- Create network security policy templates for workload classification

**Start Status**: Can start after Stream B resource controls are established

### Stream D: Storage Isolation & Monitoring
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `infrastructure/storage/isolation/`, `config/falco/`, `monitoring/security/`
**Dependencies**: Streams A & B (needs runtime and resource controls), Task 010 (Container Runtime)
**Work**:
- Implement ephemeral storage with copy-on-write overlays for workloads
- Set up encrypted storage volumes for sensitive data with key management
- Configure secure secret injection mechanisms with rotation policies
- Deploy Falco for runtime security monitoring and threat detection
- Implement file integrity monitoring for critical system paths
- Configure behavioral anomaly detection and automated response policies

**Start Status**: Can start after Streams A & B are established

## Execution Strategy

**Phase 1 (Immediate)**:
- Stream A: Container Security Runtime
- Stream B: Resource Isolation & Control

**Phase 2 (After Stream B resource controls)**:
- Stream C: Network Segmentation & Sandboxing

**Phase 3 (After Streams A & B foundation)**:
- Stream D: Storage Isolation & Monitoring

## Coordination Points

1. **Stream B → Stream C**: Network QoS policies require resource control foundation
2. **Streams A & B → Stream D**: Security monitoring needs both runtime and resource isolation in place
3. **Stream A → Stream C**: Network namespace security depends on container runtime security context
4. **Stream D → All Streams**: Security monitoring provides feedback for policy tuning across all streams
5. **All Streams → Final Integration**: Complete isolation testing requires all security layers operational

## Success Criteria

- Container isolation framework operational with gVisor/Kata secure runtime
- Resource isolation policies enforced with <10% performance overhead
- Network segmentation prevents cross-workload communication and data exfiltration
- Storage isolation protects sensitive data with encryption and access controls
- Security monitoring detects policy violations and anomalous behavior
- Sandboxing successfully contains simulated malicious workloads in testing
- Performance benchmarks validate isolation overhead is within acceptable thresholds
- All security policies documented and integrated with orchestration system
- End-to-end security testing validates isolation under attack scenarios
- Operational procedures established for incident response and policy updates
