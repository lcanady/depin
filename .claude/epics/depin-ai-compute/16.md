## Description

Develop comprehensive Ethereum-compatible smart contracts to handle all token operations within the DePIN AI compute marketplace. This includes payment processing, escrow mechanisms, fee distribution, token staking, and rewards systems. The contracts will form the financial backbone of the platform, ensuring secure and transparent transactions between compute providers and consumers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Payment contract deployed and verified on target blockchain
- [ ] Escrow mechanism implemented with automatic release conditions
- [ ] Fee distribution system with configurable rates for platform, providers, and validators
- [ ] Token staking contract with lockup periods and reward calculations
- [ ] Reward distribution system based on compute provision and network participation
- [ ] Emergency pause and upgrade mechanisms implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive contract testing suite with >95% coverage
- [ ] Gas optimization analysis and implementation
- [ ] Security audit preparation documentation
- [ ] Integration interfaces documented for backend services

## Technical Details

**Smart Contract Architecture:**
- PaymentContract: Core payment processing and escrow
- StakingContract: Token staking and reward distribution
- FeeManager: Configurable fee structures and distribution
- GovernanceContract: Upgrade mechanisms and emergency controls

**Key Features:**
- Multi-signature wallet integration for high-value operations
- Time-locked escrow with dispute resolution mechanisms
- Dynamic fee structures based on network conditions
- Staking rewards calculated using time-weighted formulas
- Cross-chain compatibility preparation (future-proofing)

**Security Considerations:**
- Reentrancy protection on all external calls
- Integer overflow/underflow protection
- Access control with role-based permissions
- Emergency circuit breakers for critical functions
- Formal verification for core mathematical operations

## Dependencies

- **External:** Ethereum development environment, testing frameworks
- **Internal:** No dependencies on other tasks (can be developed independently)

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** XL (4-5 days)
**Complexity:** High - Smart contract development requires specialized security considerations
**Risk:** Medium - Well-established patterns but requires thorough testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All smart contracts compiled and deployable
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite passing with >95% coverage
- [ ] Gas usage optimized and documented
- [ ] Security review completed with no critical issues
- [ ] Contract interfaces documented for integration
- [ ] Deployment scripts and configuration ready
- [ ] Testnet deployment successful
- [ ] Integration documentation provided for dependent tasks
