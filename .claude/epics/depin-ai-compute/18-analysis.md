# Issue #18 Analysis: Resource Health Monitoring and Metrics

## Parallel Work Stream Decomposition

This health monitoring task can be decomposed into 4 parallel streams that can work simultaneously on different aspects of the monitoring system:

### Stream A: Health Monitoring Service
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `services/health-monitor/`, `monitoring/health/`
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately, integrates with existing discovery)
**Work**:
- Build real-time GPU health monitoring service
- Implement continuous resource status tracking
- Create health check endpoints and APIs
- Provider health status polling and aggregation
- Integration with existing GPU discovery service

### Stream B: Metrics Collection Engine
**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Files**: `services/metrics-collector/`, `monitoring/metrics/`
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Work**:
- Implement Prometheus metrics collection
- Build NVML/GPU metrics extraction
- Create time-series data collection and storage
- Performance metrics (utilization, temperature, memory)
- Historical data aggregation and storage

### Stream C: Alerting & Failure Detection
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `services/alerting/`, `monitoring/alerts/`
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs health monitoring data)
**Work**:
- Build automated failure detection algorithms
- Implement threshold-based alerting system
- Create AlertManager integration and routing
- Recovery procedures for transient failures
- Notification channels and escalation policies

### Stream D: Dashboards & Visualization
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `monitoring/dashboards/`, `web/monitoring-ui/`
**Dependencies**: Streams A & B (needs monitoring data and metrics)
**Work**:
- Build Grafana dashboards for resource monitoring
- Create metrics visualization and trending
- Implement resource status API for external integration
- Build monitoring web interface and reports
- Performance analytics and capacity planning views

## Execution Strategy

**Phase 1 (Immediate)**:
- Stream A: Health Monitoring Service
- Stream B: Metrics Collection Engine

**Phase 2 (After Stream A)**:
- Stream C: Alerting & Failure Detection

**Phase 3 (After Streams A & B)**:
- Stream D: Dashboards & Visualization

## Coordination Points

1. **Stream A → Stream C**: Alerting needs health status data
2. **Streams A & B → Stream D**: Dashboards need both health and metrics data
3. **All Streams → Integration**: Complete monitoring stack integration
4. **Existing Services**: Integration with GPU discovery (#15) and provider registration

## Success Criteria

- All 4 streams complete their scope
- Real-time health monitoring operational
- Comprehensive metrics collection working
- Automated alerting and failure detection active
- Complete monitoring dashboards and visualization
- Integration with existing GPU discovery system
- Performance meets scale requirements for DePIN network
