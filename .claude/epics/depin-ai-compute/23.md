## Description

Build a comprehensive test suite covering all aspects of the DePIN AI compute platform. This includes unit tests for individual components, integration tests for service interactions, and end-to-end tests for complete user workflows. The test suite must ensure reliability, performance, and correctness of the entire system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for all core services (compute orchestration, resource management, billing)
- [ ] Integration tests for service-to-service communication
- [ ] End-to-end tests for complete user workflows (job submission, execution, payment)
- [ ] Performance tests for scalability verification
- [ ] Security tests for authentication and authorization
- [ ] Test coverage of at least 80% for critical components
- [ ] Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test data management and cleanup procedures
- [ ] Comprehensive error scenario testing
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent operations

## Technical Details

### Test Architecture
- Use pytest framework for Python components
- Implement test fixtures for database and service mocking
- Create test data factories for consistent test scenarios
- Set up isolated test environments

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Individual function and class testing
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Focus on business logic correctness

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Service-to-service communication
   - Database interaction testing
   - API endpoint validation

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Complete user journey testing
   - Multi-service workflow validation
   - Real environment simulation

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Load testing for concurrent users
   - Resource utilization monitoring
   - Response time validation

5. **Security Tests**
   - Authentication flow testing
   - Authorization boundary validation
   - Input sanitization verification

## Dependencies

- **Task 007**: Compute orchestration service (core functionality to test)
- **Task 011**: Resource management service (resource allocation testing)
- **Task 014**: Billing and payment integration (payment flow testing)

## Effort Estimate

**XL (4-5 days)**

- Day 1: Test framework setup and unit test foundation
- Day 2: Core service unit tests (orchestration, resource management)
- Day 3: Integration tests and service interaction validation
- Day 4: End-to-end workflow tests and performance testing
- Day 5: Security tests and test suite optimization

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All test categories implemented and passing
- [ ] Test coverage reports generated and reviewed
- [ ] Test execution integrated into development workflow
- [ ] Test documentation and maintenance procedures created
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Security test scenarios validated
- [ ] Test data management automated
- [ ] Continuous integration test execution configured
