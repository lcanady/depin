# Task 004: GPU Resource Discovery and Registration

## Description

Implement a comprehensive provider registration system that automatically discovers GPU resources across the network and registers them with the central resource management system. This task focuses on building the foundation for resource inventory management, including GPU detection, capability verification, and maintaining an up-to-date registry of available compute resources.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Provider registration API endpoint implemented
- [ ] GPU detection service automatically discovers available GPUs
- [ ] Capability verification validates GPU specifications and performance
- [ ] Resource inventory database stores comprehensive GPU metadata
- [ ] Registration process handles provider authentication and authorization
- [ ] System maintains real-time inventory of available resources
- [ ] Provider heartbeat mechanism ensures registry freshness
- [ ] GPU specifications include memory, compute capability, and driver versions
- [ ] Registration handles both static and dynamic resource pools
- [ ] Error handling for failed registrations and network issues

## Technical Details

### Components to Implement
- **Provider Registration Service**: REST API for resource provider onboarding
- **GPU Discovery Engine**: Service to detect and catalog GPU hardware
- **Capability Verification Module**: Validates GPU performance and compatibility
- **Resource Inventory Database**: Stores comprehensive resource metadata
- **Authentication Service**: Secures provider registration process

### Key Technologies
- Kubernetes for service orchestration
- NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) for GPU detection
- gRPC for efficient service communication
- Database for persistent resource inventory
- Authentication tokens for provider security

### Integration Points
- Kubernetes cluster management (dependency on Task 001)
- Resource monitoring system (prepares for Task 005)
- Allocation system interface (prepares for Task 006)

## Dependencies

- **Task 001**: Kubernetes Infrastructure Setup - Required for service deployment and orchestration

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: L (Large - 3-4 days)

**Breakdown**:
- Provider registration API: 1 day
- GPU discovery and detection: 1.5 days
- Capability verification: 1 day
- Resource inventory and database: 0.5 days

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed and verified
- [ ] Unit tests implemented with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end registration flow
- [ ] Performance tests demonstrate system can handle expected load
- [ ] Documentation includes API specifications and deployment guides
- [ ] Security review completed for authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Monitoring and logging implemented for all registration activities
- [ ] Error handling tested for various failure scenarios
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment and validated
