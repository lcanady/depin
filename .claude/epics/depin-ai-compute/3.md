# Task 014: Authentication and Authorization System

## Description

Build a comprehensive authentication and authorization system that combines traditional JWT-based authentication with Web3 wallet integration for the DePIN AI compute network. The system will implement role-based access control (RBAC), API security, and rate limiting to ensure secure access to compute resources and protect against unauthorized usage and abuse.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] JWT-based authentication service with secure token management
- [ ] Web3 wallet integration supporting major wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions
- [ ] API gateway with authentication, authorization, and rate limiting
- [ ] Session management with secure token refresh and revocation
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support for sensitive operations
- [ ] Audit logging for all authentication and authorization events
- [ ] Integration tests validate security policies and access controls

## Technical Details

### Authentication Service
- Implement OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect compatible service
- Support JWT tokens with RS256 signing and secure key rotation
- Integrate Web3 authentication via wallet signature verification
- Implement secure session management with refresh tokens
- Support for API keys and service-to-service authentication

### Web3 Integration
- Support EIP-191 and EIP-712 signature standards
- Implement wallet connection and signature verification
- Handle multiple blockchain networks (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
- Integrate with wallet providers via WalletConnect protocol
- Support for smart contract-based authentication

### Authorization Framework
- Implement RBAC with roles, permissions, and resource scoping
- Support attribute-based access control (ABAC) for complex policies
- Create permission hierarchies for compute resource access
- Implement dynamic permission evaluation with policy engine
- Support for temporary access grants and time-based permissions

### API Security
- Deploy API gateway with authentication enforcement
- Implement rate limiting with different tiers based on user roles
- Set up request/response validation and sanitization
- Configure CORS policies and security headers
- Implement API versioning and deprecation management

### Security Features
- Multi-factor authentication using TOTP and hardware tokens
- Account lockout and brute force protection
- Suspicious activity detection and alerting
- Secure password policies and breach detection
- Compliance with security standards (OWASP, NIST)

## Dependencies

None - this is a foundational security service that can be developed independently and integrated with other components.

## Effort Estimate

**Size: L (Large - 3-4 days)**

This is a comprehensive security system requiring:
- Implementation of multiple authentication mechanisms
- Complex authorization policy engine development
- Web3 integration with various wallet providers
- Extensive security testing and vulnerability assessment
- Integration with API gateway and rate limiting systems

## Definition of Done

- Authentication service supports both JWT and Web3 wallet authentication
- RBAC system successfully controls access to compute resources
- API gateway enforces authentication and rate limiting policies
- Web3 integration works with major wallet providers
- Multi-factor authentication is functional for administrative operations
- Security audit reveals no critical vulnerabilities
- Performance testing validates system handles expected user load
- Documentation covers authentication flows and authorization policies
- Integration tests validate end-to-end security workflows
- System complies with relevant security standards and best practices
