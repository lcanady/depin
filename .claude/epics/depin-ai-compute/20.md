## Description

Implement a comprehensive billing and financial reporting system that calculates usage-based charges, generates invoices, tracks payments, and provides detailed financial analytics. This system will handle complex pricing models based on compute resource consumption, provide transparent billing to users, and generate business intelligence for platform optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Usage-based billing calculation engine with configurable pricing tiers
- [ ] Automated invoice generation with detailed usage breakdowns
- [ ] Payment tracking and reconciliation with blockchain transactions
- [ ] Financial reporting dashboard with key metrics and analytics
- [ ] Multi-currency support and exchange rate handling
- [ ] Billing history and dispute management system
- [ ] Automated payment reminders and notifications
- [ ] Tax calculation and compliance reporting features
- [ ] API endpoints for billing data access and integration
- [ ] Export functionality for accounting systems (CSV, PDF, API)

## Technical Details

**System Architecture:**
- BillingEngine: Core usage calculation and pricing logic
- InvoiceGenerator: Automated invoice creation and formatting
- PaymentTracker: Integration with payment engine for reconciliation
- ReportingService: Analytics and business intelligence generation

**Key Features:**
- Flexible pricing models (pay-per-use, subscription, hybrid)
- Usage aggregation from multiple compute metrics
- Automated billing cycles with configurable periods
- Real-time billing estimates and cost projections
- Integration with accounting standards (GAAP compliance)
- Multi-tenant billing isolation and security

**Billing Models:**
- Compute time-based billing (per second/minute/hour)
- Resource utilization pricing (CPU, memory, storage, network)
- Performance tier-based pricing (GPU types, compute classes)
- Volume discounts and enterprise pricing
- Token-based prepaid billing options

**Reporting Features:**
- Revenue analytics and trends
- User spending patterns and forecasting
- Resource utilization efficiency metrics
- Payment method performance analysis
- Churn and retention financial impact

## Dependencies

- **Dependent on:** Task 011 (Payment Engine) - Requires transaction data and payment integration
- **External:** Accounting system APIs, tax calculation services, exchange rate APIs
- **Internal:** Usage monitoring system, user management, notification service

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** M (2-3 days)
**Complexity:** Medium - Standard billing logic with some complex integrations
**Risk:** Low - Well-established patterns for billing systems

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Billing calculation engine operational with accurate usage tracking
- [ ] Invoice generation system producing compliant documents
- [ ] Payment reconciliation working with blockchain transactions
- [ ] Financial reporting dashboard accessible to administrators
- [ ] Multi-currency support implemented and tested
- [ ] Billing API endpoints documented and functional
- [ ] Automated notification system operational
- [ ] Tax calculation integration completed (if required)
- [ ] Performance testing completed for high-volume scenarios
- [ ] Integration testing with payment engine successful
