# Task 013: Workload Isolation and Sandboxing

## Description

Implement comprehensive workload isolation and sandboxing capabilities to ensure secure execution of untrusted AI compute workloads. This system will provide strong isolation boundaries between different compute jobs, prevent resource interference, and protect the host system from malicious or faulty workloads through containerization and advanced security policies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Container isolation framework is implemented with secure runtime
- [ ] Sandboxing policies prevent workload escape and privilege escalation
- [ ] Resource isolation (CPU, memory, disk, network) is enforced per workload
- [ ] Network segmentation isolates workloads from each other and host
- [ ] File system isolation with read-only base images and controlled data access
- [ ] Security context constraints prevent dangerous operations
- [ ] Workload monitoring detects and responds to security violations
- [ ] Isolation testing validates security boundaries under various attack scenarios

## Technical Details

### Container Security Runtime
- Deploy gVisor or Kata Containers for enhanced isolation
- Configure seccomp profiles to restrict system calls
- Implement AppArmor/SELinux mandatory access controls
- Set up user namespace mapping for privilege separation

### Resource Isolation
- Configure cgroups v2 for precise resource control
- Implement CPU and memory quotas per workload
- Set up disk I/O throttling and quota enforcement
- Configure network bandwidth limiting and QoS

### Network Segmentation
- Create isolated network namespaces per workload
- Implement micro-segmentation with network policies
- Set up egress filtering to control outbound connections
- Configure DNS isolation and filtering

### Sandboxing Policies
- Define security profiles for different workload types
- Implement runtime security monitoring with Falco
- Set up file integrity monitoring for critical paths
- Configure behavioral anomaly detection

### Storage Isolation
- Use ephemeral storage with copy-on-write overlays
- Implement encrypted storage for sensitive data
- Set up secure secret injection mechanisms
- Configure audit logging for all file system access

## Dependencies

- **Task 002**: Container Runtime and Orchestration - requires the container runtime infrastructure to implement advanced isolation features

## Effort Estimate

**Size: XL (Extra Large - 4-5 days)**

This is a complex security-critical task requiring:
- Deep understanding of container security and kernel isolation
- Implementation of multiple security layers and controls
- Extensive testing of isolation boundaries and attack scenarios
- Integration with container runtime and orchestration systems
- Performance optimization to minimize isolation overhead

## Definition of Done

- Container isolation framework is deployed with secure runtime (gVisor/Kata)
- Resource isolation policies are enforced and validated under load
- Network segmentation prevents cross-workload communication
- Security monitoring detects and alerts on policy violations
- Sandboxing successfully contains malicious test workloads
- Performance impact of isolation is within acceptable thresholds (<10% overhead)
- Security testing validates isolation under simulated attacks
- Documentation covers security architecture and operational procedures
- Integration with orchestration system allows dynamic policy application
