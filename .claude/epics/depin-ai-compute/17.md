## Description

Build a robust payment processing backend service that interfaces with the smart contracts to handle all financial transactions in the DePIN AI compute marketplace. This includes transaction validation, reconciliation, wallet integration, and balance management. The system will provide a reliable abstraction layer between the application logic and blockchain operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Payment processing service with REST API endpoints
- [ ] Transaction validation and status tracking system
- [ ] Automatic reconciliation between database and blockchain state
- [ ] Wallet integration for multiple provider types (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- [ ] Balance management system with real-time updates
- [ ] Transaction retry and failure handling mechanisms
- [ ] Payment history and audit trail functionality
- [ ] Integration with smart contracts from Task 010
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting system
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Technical Details

**Service Architecture:**
- PaymentService: Core transaction processing logic
- TransactionMonitor: Blockchain event monitoring and reconciliation
- WalletManager: Multi-wallet integration and management
- BalanceTracker: Real-time balance calculation and caching

**Key Features:**
- Asynchronous transaction processing with queuing
- Real-time blockchain event monitoring and parsing
- Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Transaction batching for gas optimization
- Multi-signature transaction support
- Webhook notifications for transaction status updates

**Database Schema:**
- Transactions table with status, timestamps, and metadata
- Wallet associations and balance cache
- Payment history and reconciliation logs
- Fee calculation and distribution records

**Integration Points:**
- Smart contracts (Task 010) for blockchain operations
- User management system for wallet associations
- Notification service for transaction updates
- Analytics service for payment metrics

## Dependencies

- **Dependent on:** Task 010 (Smart Contract Development) - Requires deployed contracts
- **External:** Blockchain node access, database system, message queue
- **Internal:** User authentication system, notification service

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** L (3-4 days)
**Complexity:** High - Complex integration between blockchain and traditional backend
**Risk:** Medium - Dependent on smart contract completion and blockchain reliability

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Payment processing service deployed and operational
- [ ] All API endpoints tested and documented
- [ ] Smart contract integration fully functional
- [ ] Transaction monitoring and reconciliation working
- [ ] Wallet integration supporting major providers
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (target: <2s transaction processing)
- [ ] Security audit completed for payment flows
- [ ] Integration tests passing with smart contracts
- [ ] Documentation provided for API consumers
