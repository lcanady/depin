# Issue #6 Analysis: Kubernetes Cluster Setup and Configuration

## Parallel Work Stream Decomposition

This foundational task can be decomposed into 4 parallel streams that can work simultaneously on different aspects of the Kubernetes infrastructure:

### Stream A: Core Cluster & Networking
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `infrastructure/k8s/cluster/`, `infrastructure/k8s/networking/`
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Work**:
- Deploy base Kubernetes cluster (3+ control plane nodes)
- Configure high availability for control plane
- Set up CNI networking (Calico/Cilium)
- Configure cluster DNS and service discovery
- Basic cluster health validation

### Stream B: Storage & Persistence
**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Files**: `infrastructure/k8s/storage/`, `infrastructure/k8s/volumes/`
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Work**:
- Deploy storage provisioners for persistent volumes
- Configure storage classes for different performance tiers
- Set up backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Test persistent volume creation and attachment

### Stream C: Security & RBAC
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `infrastructure/k8s/security/`, `infrastructure/k8s/rbac/`
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs cluster running)
**Work**:
- Implement Pod Security Standards
- Configure network policies for traffic segmentation
- Set up RBAC roles and service accounts
- Enable audit logging and monitoring
- Security validation and testing

### Stream D: Essential Operators
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `infrastructure/k8s/operators/`, `infrastructure/k8s/monitoring/`
**Dependencies**: Streams A & C (needs secure cluster)
**Work**:
- Deploy monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Set up logging aggregation (ELK/EFK stack)
- Install ingress controller for external access
- Deploy cert-manager for TLS certificate automation
- Operator health validation

## Execution Strategy

**Phase 1 (Immediate)**:
- Stream A: Core Cluster & Networking
- Stream B: Storage & Persistence

**Phase 2 (After Stream A)**:
- Stream C: Security & RBAC

**Phase 3 (After Streams A & C)**:
- Stream D: Essential Operators

## Coordination Points

1. **Stream A → Stream C**: Security setup requires running cluster
2. **Streams A & C → Stream D**: Operators require secure, running cluster
3. **All Streams → Documentation**: Final integration documentation

## Success Criteria

- All 4 streams complete their scope
- Integration testing passes
- Full cluster validation successful
- Documentation complete and reviewed
