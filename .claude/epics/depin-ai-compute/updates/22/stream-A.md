# Issue #22 - Stream A: Performance Analysis Engine

## Progress Status: In Progress

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Analyzed existing analytics infrastructure from issue #19
- [x] Reviewed performance analyzer in analytics/provider/
- [x] Created progress tracking file

### Current Task:
- [ ] Building workload performance analysis system

### Next Tasks:
- [ ] Implement performance bottleneck detection algorithms
- [ ] Create workload pattern recognition and classification
- [ ] Develop performance metrics aggregation and analysis
- [ ] Build historical performance trend analysis

### Files Modified:
- Created: .claude/epics/depin-ai-compute/updates/22/stream-A.md

### Architecture Notes:
- Existing performance analyzer in analytics/provider/ focuses on provider-level analysis
- Need to create services/performance/ for workload-level analysis
- Will build on DePIN analytics engine from issue #19
- Performance analysis should be intelligent and identify optimization opportunities

### Key Design Decisions:
- Create new services/performance/ directory for core performance analysis
- Create analytics/optimization/ for optimization algorithms
- Create models/performance/ for performance data models
- Focus on workload-level performance analysis vs provider-level analysis
