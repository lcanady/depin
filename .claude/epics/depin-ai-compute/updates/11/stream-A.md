# Issue #11 - Stream A: IPFS Node Deployment

## Status
**Current Status**: COMPLETED
**Started**: 2025-08-24T21:54:00Z
**Completed**: 2025-08-24T22:15:00Z
**Stream**: IPFS Node Deployment

## My Scope
- Files to modify: `ipfs/nodes/`, `k8s/ipfs/`, `config/ipfs/`
- Work to complete:
  - Deploy IPFS nodes as Kubernetes StatefulSets
  - Configure cluster mode for high availability
  - Set up persistent storage for IPFS data
  - Configure network connectivity and peer discovery
  - Implement IPFS cluster coordination and consensus

## Progress Log

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create IPFS node directory structure
- [x] Design StatefulSet configuration for IPFS nodes
- [x] Set up persistent storage configuration
- [x] Configure network connectivity

### Phase 2: Cluster Configuration (COMPLETED)
- [x] Configure IPFS cluster mode for high availability
- [x] Set up peer discovery and networking
- [x] Implement cluster coordination and consensus
- [x] Configure failover mechanisms

### Phase 3: Integration & Monitoring (COMPLETED)
- [x] Set up node health monitoring
- [x] Configure metrics collection
- [x] Implement alerting for failures
- [x] Add performance monitoring

## Key Deliverables
- [x] Production IPFS node cluster deployment
- [x] StatefulSet configuration with persistent storage
- [x] Network peering and discovery configuration
- [x] Cluster coordination and failover mechanisms
- [x] Node health monitoring and metrics

## Technical Decisions Made
- Using StatefulSets for IPFS nodes to ensure stable network identities
- Implementing IPFS cluster for high availability and coordination
- Using persistent volumes for IPFS data storage
- Configuring service discovery for peer connectivity

## Blocked Items
- None currently

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created:
- `/k8s/ipfs/ipfs-statefulset.yaml` - Core IPFS StatefulSet with cluster integration
- `/k8s/ipfs/ipfs-storage.yaml` - Persistent storage configuration with fast SSD
- `/k8s/ipfs/ipfs-networking.yaml` - Network policies, services, and peer discovery
- `/k8s/ipfs/ipfs-monitoring.yaml` - Health monitoring and Prometheus metrics
- `/config/ipfs/cluster-config.yaml` - IPFS cluster configuration and scripts
- `/ipfs/cluster/coordination.yaml` - Cluster coordination and failover mechanisms
- `/ipfs/nodes/deploy-ipfs-cluster.sh` - Automated deployment script
- `/ipfs/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **High Availability**: 3-node cluster with CRDT consensus
2. **Persistent Storage**: Fast SSD storage with 100GB per node + backup volumes
3. **Network Security**: Network policies and service discovery
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive health monitoring with Prometheus metrics
5. **Automation**: Complete deployment and management scripts
6. **Documentation**: Detailed setup and operation guides

### Technical Highlights:
- StatefulSets ensure stable network identities for cluster peers
- IPFS Cluster provides distributed coordination and consensus
- Persistent volumes with node affinity for performance
- Health monitoring with automatic failover detection
- Prometheus metrics for observability and alerting

## Coordination Notes
- ✅ Providing foundation for Stream B (Content Management) content addressing
- ✅ Ready for Stream C (Gateway/API) HTTP access point integration
- ✅ Storage layer prepared for Stream D (K8s Integration) CSI driver
- ✅ All coordination interfaces defined and documented
