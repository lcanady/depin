- Integrated with existing GPU metrics collection pipeline

**Exported Metrics Categories:**
- Network Health: 10 metrics (provider availability, latency, decentralization)
- Economic: 10 metrics (token flows, payment volumes, fees)
- Reputation: 16 metrics (provider scores, job completion, SLA compliance)

### 6. Storage Integration
**Enhanced**: `services/metrics-collector/storage/timeseries.py`
- Extended InfluxDB storage to support DePIN metrics
- Added `write_depin_metrics()` method with optimized point conversion
- Implemented specialized storage format for DePIN metric categories
- Added metadata support for additional metric context

### 7. Configuration Management
**File**: `config/metrics/depin_config.yaml`
- Created comprehensive configuration for DePIN metrics collection
- Defined collection intervals, alert thresholds, and scoring weights
- Added analytics configuration with prediction models and anomaly detection
- Included API endpoints, dashboard integration, and alerting configuration

### 8. Main Service Integration
**Enhanced**: `services/metrics-collector/main.py`
- Integrated DePIN collector into main service orchestrator
- Added DePIN metrics collection and forwarding loops
- Implemented health check integration for DePIN components
- Added proper service lifecycle management

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Provider Registry → DePIN Collectors → Analytics Engine → Storage (InfluxDB)
                                   ↘                    ↗
                                    Prometheus Exporter → Grafana Dashboards
```

### Metric Categories
1. **Network Health**: Provider availability, connectivity, geographic distribution
2. **Economic**: Token flows, payment volumes, fee structures, market activity
3. **Reputation**: Provider reliability, job performance, SLA compliance
4. **Geographic**: Regional distribution, decentralization scoring

### Collection Intervals
- Network Health: 30 seconds
- Economic Metrics: 60 seconds  
- Reputation Metrics: 120 seconds
- Analytics Processing: 300 seconds

## Key Achievements

### 1. Comprehensive DePIN Intelligence
