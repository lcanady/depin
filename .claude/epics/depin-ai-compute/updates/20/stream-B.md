### In Progress Tasks ðŸ”„
None - Stream B work is complete

### Pending Tasks ðŸ“‹
None - All Stream B deliverables completed

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Integration Approach**: Build on top of Stream A's billing engine for data source
2. **Service Architecture**: Follow Go microservice pattern established in codebase
3. **Template System**: Use Go's html/template for professional invoice formatting
4. **Data Flow**: Billing data â†’ Invoice generation â†’ Template rendering â†’ Storage â†’ API access

### Key Implementation Areas

#### Automated Invoice Generation
- Professional invoice creation with detailed usage breakdowns
- Multiple format support (PDF, HTML, JSON)
- Compliance-ready formatting with tax calculations

#### Invoice Management System
- Billing history tracking and search
- Dispute management workflow
- Invoice status tracking and updates

#### Notification System
- Automated payment reminders
- Overdue notifications with escalation
- Email and webhook delivery options

#### Compliance Features
- Tax calculation integration
- Regulatory reporting capabilities
- Audit trail maintenance

### Integration Points
- **Billing Service**: Primary data source for usage and pricing information
- **Payment Service**: Integration for payment status and tracking
- **Notification Service**: For automated reminders and alerts
- **User Management**: For customer information and preferences

### Coordination with Stream A
Stream A has completed the billing engine which provides:
- Usage calculation and aggregation
- Pricing models and cost estimation
- Multi-currency support with exchange rates
- Automated billing cycles
- Comprehensive billing data API

Stream B has successfully consumed this billing data to generate professional invoices and manage the billing lifecycle.
