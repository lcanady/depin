   - Escrow configuration validation

6. **Retry Mechanisms** (`services/payment/internal/retry/manager.go`)
   - Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Configurable retry policies
   - Statistics tracking for monitoring

7. **Error Handling** (`services/payment/internal/handlers/error_handler.go`)
   - Structured error types with user-friendly messages
   - Security-focused error sanitization
   - Comprehensive error categorization

8. **Transaction Queue** (`services/payment/internal/queue/service.go`)
   - Priority-based transaction processing
   - Background worker pool implementation
   - Automatic retry and failure handling

9. **Service Configuration** (`services/payment/config/config.yaml`)
   - Complete production-ready configuration
   - Environment variable support
   - Security and monitoring settings

10. **Main Service** (`services/payment/cmd/payment/main.go`)
    - Production-ready service entry point
    - Graceful shutdown handling
    - Health checks and metrics endpoints

11. **Comprehensive Tests** (`services/payment/tests/payment_service_test.go`)
    - Unit tests with mock implementations
    - Business logic validation tests
    - Performance benchmarks

### Key Features Implemented:
- ✅ Multi-currency payment support
- ✅ Escrow-based transaction processing
- ✅ Smart contract integration for blockchain operations
- ✅ Configurable timelock and dispute windows
- ✅ Automatic payment release functionality
- ✅ Comprehensive retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- ✅ Real-time transaction status tracking
- ✅ Priority-based transaction queuing
- ✅ Robust error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Production-ready logging and monitoring
- ✅ Security validations and input sanitization

## Architecture Highlights

### Service Layer Architecture:
- **PaymentService**: Core business logic coordinator
- **BlockchainService**: Ethereum/smart contract interface
- **ValidationService**: Business rule enforcement
- **QueueService**: Asynchronous transaction processing
- **RetryManager**: Resilience and failure recovery
- **ErrorHandler**: Comprehensive error management

### API Design:
- RESTful endpoints following OpenAPI standards
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Request/response validation and type safety
- Pagination and filtering support

### Data Flow:
1. API receives payment request
2. Validation service validates input
3. Payment service creates payment record
4. Transaction queued for blockchain processing
5. Background workers process blockchain transactions
6. Status updates propagated back to clients
7. Retry mechanisms handle failures automatically

## Production Readiness

### Security:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error message sanitization to prevent information leakage
- Secure wallet address validation
- Private key handling in blockchain service

### Monitoring:
- Structured logging with contextual information
- Prometheus metrics integration points
- Health check endpoints
- Transaction tracing and audit trails

### Configuration:
- Environment-based configuration
- Production/development profiles
- Configurable retry policies and timeouts
- Feature flags for different capabilities

### Testing:
- Comprehensive unit test coverage
- Mock implementations for all dependencies
- Business logic validation tests
- Performance benchmarks

## Final Deliverable Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All stream requirements fulfilled
