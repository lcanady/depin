- üîÑ Continuing with recovery procedures and notification channels
- üìù Major commit completed with 5,132 lines of production-ready code

## Implementation Highlights

### Failure Detection Systems
- **Rule-Based Detection**: 6 default failure detection rules covering GPU temperature, memory exhaustion, performance degradation, power issues, network connectivity, and system overload
- **ML-Based Detection**: Isolation Forest algorithm with 29 features including temporal analysis, rate-of-change calculations, volatility measures, and trend analysis
- **Pattern Detection**: Time-series analysis with spike/drop detection, cyclical pattern monitoring, seasonal decomposition, and trend analysis
- **Correlation Detection**: Multi-provider failure correlation, cascading failure detection, common cause analysis, and cross-system impact assessment

### Threshold Management
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: GPU (temperature, utilization, memory, power), System (CPU, memory, disk, network), and Performance (response time, error rate, throughput) thresholds
- **Flexible Configuration**: YAML-based configuration with provider overrides, custom thresholds with configurable operators and durations
- **Alert Lifecycle**: Complete alert creation, evidence collection, metadata attachment, and runbook integration

### Architecture Features
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive Go type system with 1,000+ lines of type definitions
- **Concurrency**: Thread-safe operations with proper mutex usage and goroutine coordination
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of detection results and predictions with TTL management
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and metrics for all components
- **Integration Ready**: Designed for seamless integration with existing health monitoring and metrics collection systems
