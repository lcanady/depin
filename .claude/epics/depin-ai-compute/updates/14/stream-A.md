# Stream A Progress: Prometheus Deployment & Configuration

## Task: Issue #14 - Prometheus/Grafana Monitoring Stack Setup
**Stream**: A - Prometheus Deployment & Configuration
**Status**: In Progress
**Started**: 2025-08-24

## My Scope
- Files to modify: `infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus/`, `config/prometheus/`, `k8s/monitoring/prometheus/`
- Work to complete:
  - Deploy Prometheus server using Helm chart or Kubernetes manifests
  - Configure service discovery for pods and services
  - Set up scraping intervals and retention policies
  - Configure storage for time-series data
  - Implement security best practices and access controls

## Progress

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup ✅
- [x] Create directory structure for Prometheus configuration
- [x] Set up Kubernetes namespace for monitoring  
- [x] Configure RBAC for Prometheus service account
- [x] Create storage configuration for time-series data

### Phase 2: Prometheus Deployment ✅
- [x] Create Kubernetes manifests for Prometheus deployment
- [x] Configure Prometheus ConfigMap with scraping rules
- [x] Set up service discovery for pods and services
- [x] Configure retention policies and storage

### Phase 3: Security & Performance ✅
- [x] Implement security best practices
- [x] Configure access controls
- [x] Optimize scraping intervals and resource limits
- [x] Test service discovery and metrics collection

### Phase 4: Documentation & Tooling ✅
- [x] Create deployment automation scripts
- [x] Create comprehensive validation tools
- [x] Write detailed documentation
- [x] Set up monitoring for Prometheus itself

- f9c471e: Issue #14: Complete Prometheus deployment and configuration for DePIN monitoring

## Deliverables Completed

### Key Files Created:
1. **k8s/monitoring/prometheus/service-account.yaml** - RBAC configuration
2. **k8s/monitoring/prometheus/prometheus-config.yaml** - Main configuration with service discovery
3. **k8s/monitoring/prometheus/prometheus-deployment.yaml** - StatefulSet deployment 
4. **k8s/monitoring/prometheus/prometheus-rules.yaml** - Alerting and recording rules
5. **k8s/monitoring/prometheus/security-config.yaml** - Security policies
6. **config/prometheus/storage-config.yaml** - Storage and backup configuration
7. **infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus/deploy-prometheus.sh** - Automated deployment
8. **infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus/validate-prometheus.sh** - Validation tools
9. **infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus/README.md** - Comprehensive documentation

### Features Implemented:
- High-availability StatefulSet with 2 replicas

- Production-ready security configuration
- 60-day retention with optimized storage
- Automated deployment and validation
- Complete observability stack ready for Grafana integration

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Stream A work is complete. Ready for integration with Stream B (Grafana) and Stream C (Alerting).

## Notes
- Working in worktree: ../epic-depin-ai-compute/
- All Prometheus infrastructure is production-ready
- Ready to coordinate with Stream B (Grafana) and Stream C (Alerting)
