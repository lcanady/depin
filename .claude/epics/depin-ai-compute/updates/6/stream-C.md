# Stream C: Security & RBAC

## Scope
- Implement Pod Security Standards
- Configure network policies for traffic segmentation
- Set up RBAC roles and service accounts
- Enable audit logging and monitoring
- Security validation and testing

## Files
- infrastructure/k8s/security/
- infrastructure/k8s/rbac/

## Progress
- âœ… Stream A (core cluster) completed - cluster infrastructure ready
- âœ… Updated progress file to 'in_progress'
- âœ… Implemented Pod Security Standards configurations (restricted, baseline, privileged)
- âœ… Created network policies for traffic segmentation with default-deny approach
- âœ… Set up RBAC roles and service accounts with principle of least privilege
- âœ… Configured comprehensive audit logging and security monitoring
- âœ… Deployed admission controllers for policy enforcement (custom + OPA Gatekeeper)
- âœ… Implemented security validation and testing scripts with compliance checks
- âœ… Created comprehensive documentation for security procedures
- âœ… All security framework components committed to git
- ðŸŸ¢ **SECURITY COMPLETE**: Comprehensive security framework ready for Stream D (operators)

## Deliverables Completed
- infrastructure/k8s/security/ - Complete security framework
- infrastructure/k8s/rbac/ - Role-based access control system
- Pod Security Standards for all security zones (restricted, baseline, privileged)
- Network policies with micro-segmentation and default-deny
- Service accounts and RBAC roles following least privilege
- Admission controllers with policy enforcement and validation
- Audit logging with security event monitoring and alerting
- Security testing suite with validation and compliance checks
- Comprehensive documentation and deployment procedures
- Security framework ready for AI workloads and system operators

## Stream D Dependencies Met
- Created service accounts that operators will need (depin-operator, depin-monitoring, depin-logging)
- Security policies configured to allow operator deployments in depin-system namespace
- Network policies allow monitoring and logging traffic patterns
- RBAC permissions grant operators necessary cluster management capabilities
