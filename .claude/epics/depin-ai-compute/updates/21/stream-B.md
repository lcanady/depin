# Stream B: Optimization Engine & Algorithms

## Scope
- Implement intelligent allocation algorithms (bin packing, genetic algorithms)
- Build resource utilization optimization across providers
- Create cost optimization algorithms for provider selection
- Dynamic rebalancing algorithms based on performance metrics
- Machine learning models for allocation optimization

## Files
- services/optimization/
- algorithms/scheduling/

## Progress
- Ready to start implementation
