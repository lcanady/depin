## Files Created:
### Core Types and Services:
- `web/provider-dashboard/src/types/resources.ts` - Complete TypeScript definitions
- `web/provider-dashboard/src/services/resourcesApi.ts` - API service with WebSocket support
- `web/provider-dashboard/src/hooks/useResourceManagement.ts` - Custom hook for state management

### Resource Management Components:
- `web/provider-dashboard/components/resources/ResourceConfiguration.tsx` - Comprehensive configuration interface
- `web/provider-dashboard/components/resources/ResourceStatusManager.tsx` - Status management with mode switching
- `web/provider-dashboard/components/resources/PerformanceMonitor.tsx` - Performance dashboards with charts
- `web/provider-dashboard/components/resources/RealTimeMetrics.tsx` - Live metrics with circular progress
- `web/provider-dashboard/components/resources/ResourceAlerts.tsx` - Alert and notification system
- `web/provider-dashboard/components/resources/ResourceOverview.tsx` - Resource statistics and overview

### Main Pages:
- `web/provider-dashboard/pages/resources/ResourceManagement.tsx` - Main resource management interface

### Configuration:
- `web/provider-dashboard/package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts

## Key Features Implemented:

### Resource Configuration Interface:
- GPU/CPU specification management
- Performance settings (max concurrent jobs, pricing)
- Job type selection (training, inference, preprocessing, etc.)
- Auto-shutdown configuration
- Maintenance window scheduling
- Alert threshold configuration

### Resource Status Management:
- Online/Offline/Maintenance mode switching
- Status transition validation and confirmation dialogs
- Real-time status updates via WebSocket
- Bulk status operations support

### Performance Monitoring:
- Historical performance charts with multiple time ranges
- Job statistics (completed, running, failed)
- System performance metrics (CPU, memory, temperature)
- Response time and throughput analysis
- Interactive chart with hover details

### Real-Time Utilization Metrics:
- Live CPU, memory, GPU usage with circular progress indicators
- Temperature monitoring with visual warnings
- Network activity tracking
- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Fallback to polling if WebSocket fails

### Alert and Notification System:
- Comprehensive alert management (acknowledge, resolve, dismiss)
- Alert categorization (system, performance, business)
- Severity-based filtering and display
- Alert history and details
- Real-time alert notifications

## Technical Implementation:
- **React + TypeScript** for type-safe component development
- **WebSocket integration** for real-time updates with automatic reconnection
- **Custom hooks** for clean state management and API integration
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS classes
- **Error handling** with proper fallbacks and user feedback
- **Performance optimization** with efficient re-rendering patterns

## Notes:
- All components are fully integrated and production-ready
- WebSocket connections include automatic reconnection logic
- Error handling implemented throughout with user-friendly messages
- Components are designed to work independently or together
- Ready for integration with Stream A layout components
- All requirements from the original task specification have been fulfilled

## Ready for Stream Integration:
The resource management interface is complete and ready for integration with the overall provider dashboard layout. All components are modular and can be easily integrated into the main dashboard structure.
