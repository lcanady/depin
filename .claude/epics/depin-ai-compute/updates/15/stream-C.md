# Stream C: Resource Inventory Database

## Scope
- Design resource inventory database schema
- Implement CRUD operations for GPU metadata
- Build resource indexing and search capabilities
- Create data persistence and backup procedures
- Database migration and versioning scripts

## Files
- database/inventory/
- models/resources/

## Progress
- ✅ Stream A completed - Provider API contracts available
- ✅ Stream B GPU data structures available
- ✅ Created comprehensive resource data models (common, GPU, provider)
- ✅ Built database configuration and connection management
- ✅ Created PostgreSQL schema with indexes and triggers
- ✅ Implemented database migration system with versioning
- ✅ Built repository interfaces for all components
- ✅ Implemented provider repository with caching and search
- ✅ Implemented GPU repository with allocation management
- ✅ Built health check and verification repositories
- ✅ Created usage metrics repository with time-series support
- ✅ Implemented repository manager with transaction support
- ✅ Built backup and disaster recovery system
- ✅ Created CLI tools for migration and backup management
- ✅ Added comprehensive integration test suite
- ✅ Created complete documentation and README
- ✅ Stream C completed - Ready for Stream D integration

## Deliverables Completed
- **Database Schema**: Complete PostgreSQL schema with 12+ tables, indexes, and constraints
- **Repository Layer**: Full CRUD repositories for providers, GPUs, health checks, verifications, and usage metrics
- **Migration System**: Version-controlled database migrations with up/down support
- **Connection Management**: Database connection pooling with health monitoring
- **Caching Layer**: Redis-based caching with configurable TTL and invalidation
- **Search & Filtering**: Advanced search capabilities with pagination and sorting
- **Backup System**: Automated backup with compression, verification, and cleanup
- **Disaster Recovery**: Point-in-time recovery and disaster recovery testing
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities for migrations and backup operations
- **Testing**: Comprehensive integration tests covering all functionality
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and deployment guides
- **Performance**: Optimized queries, batch operations, and connection pooling

## Technical Implementation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB, GIN indexes, and foreign keys
- **Caching**: Redis integration with connection pooling and health checks  
- **Transactions**: ACID-compliant transactions with rollback support
- **Migrations**: Embedded SQL migrations with version tracking
- **Monitoring**: Database health checks and performance metrics
- **Security**: Prepared statements and SQL injection protection
- **Scalability**: Connection pooling and batch operations for high throughput
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation

## Integration Points Ready
- Repository interfaces defined for all Stream D services
- Provider and GPU data models match Stream A and B specifications
- Health monitoring and heartbeat systems ready for real-time updates
- Verification system ready for capability assessment integration
- Usage metrics collection ready for monitoring service integration
- Backup system integrated with Kubernetes persistent volumes
- Migration system ready for production deployment
