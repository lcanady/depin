# Stream A: Provider Registration API

## Scope
- Build REST API for provider onboarding
- Implement provider authentication and authorization
- Create registration validation and error handling
- Provider identity management and token generation
- API documentation and OpenAPI specifications

## Files
- services/provider-registry/
- api/registration/

## Progress
- ✅ Read task requirements and understood scope
- ✅ Created complete provider registration API structure
- ✅ Implemented JWT-based authentication and authorization
- ✅ Built comprehensive input validation service
- ✅ Created provider identity management with secure API keys
- ✅ Added security middleware (CORS, rate limiting, security headers)
- ✅ Implemented structured error handling and responses
- ✅ Created OpenAPI specification and comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Added Docker containerization and build system
- ✅ Created mock repository for development
- ✅ Added unit tests for core functionality
- ✅ Committed all changes to git

## Deliverables Completed
- Provider registration REST API endpoints (/register, /auth, /profile, /refresh)
- Authentication and authorization middleware with JWT tokens
- Provider identity management system with API key generation
- Token generation and validation with configurable expiration
- API validation and error handling with detailed error responses
- OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for API documentation
- Registration flow documentation with security best practices
- Integration-ready design for database and other services

## Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Gin HTTP framework for high performance
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with HS256 signing, bcrypt for API keys
- **Validation**: Custom validation service with RSA key verification
- **Security**: Rate limiting, CORS, security headers, request timeouts
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with request tracing
- **Configuration**: Viper-based configuration with environment overrides
- **Testing**: Unit tests with mock dependencies
- **Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI spec and usage documentation
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker build with security practices

## Integration Points Ready
- JWT authentication contracts defined for downstream services
- Repository interface ready for database integration (Stream C)
- API contracts documented for GPU verification service (Stream D)
- Kubernetes deployment ready with health checks
- Monitoring and observability built-in with structured logging
