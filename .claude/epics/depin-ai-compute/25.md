## Description

Create comprehensive documentation and API reference materials for the DePIN AI compute platform. This includes technical documentation for developers, operational guides for administrators, user guides for platform participants, and complete API reference documentation. The documentation must be accessible, maintainable, and integrated into the development workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete API reference documentation with examples
- [ ] Developer integration guide and SDK documentation
- [ ] Platform architecture and system design documentation
- [ ] Deployment and operational guides for administrators
- [ ] User guides for compute providers and consumers
- [ ] Troubleshooting and FAQ documentation
- [ ] Security and compliance documentation
- [ ] Performance optimization guides
- [ ] Interactive API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Documentation versioning and maintenance procedures

## Technical Details

### Documentation Structure
1. **API Reference**
   - OpenAPI/Swagger specification
   - Interactive API explorer
   - Code examples in multiple languages
   - Authentication and authorization guides

2. **Developer Documentation**
   - Platform integration guide
   - SDK documentation and examples
   - Webhook and event system documentation
   - Best practices and patterns

3. **Architecture Documentation**
   - System design and component overview
   - Service interaction diagrams
   - Database schema documentation
   - Security architecture details

4. **Operational Documentation**
   - Deployment procedures and requirements
   - Configuration management guides
   - Monitoring and alerting setup
   - Backup and disaster recovery procedures

5. **User Documentation**
   - Getting started guides
   - Feature tutorials and walkthroughs
   - Billing and payment information
   - Community guidelines and support

### Documentation Tools
- **Documentation Generator**: Sphinx/GitBook for structured docs
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger for interactive reference
- **Version Control**: Git-based documentation workflow
- **Publishing**: Automated documentation deployment

### Content Standards
- Clear, concise writing with technical accuracy
- Code examples tested and validated
- Screenshots and diagrams for visual clarity
- Regular updates aligned with feature releases

## Dependencies

None - Documentation can be developed independently and updated as features are implemented.

## Effort Estimate

**M (2-3 days)**

- Day 1: API reference documentation and interactive explorer setup
- Day 2: Developer guides, architecture documentation, and SDK materials
- Day 3: Operational guides, user documentation, and publishing workflow

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete API reference with interactive explorer deployed
- [ ] All documentation categories completed and reviewed
- [ ] Documentation publishing workflow automated
- [ ] Version control and maintenance procedures established
- [ ] Documentation accessibility and search functionality verified
- [ ] Cross-references and navigation structure optimized
- [ ] Documentation feedback and update process defined
- [ ] Style guide and content standards documented
