# Task 015: Security Monitoring and Threat Detection

## Description

Implement a comprehensive security monitoring and threat detection system that provides real-time visibility into security events across the DePIN AI compute network. The system will collect security logs, detect threats and anomalies, generate alerts for security incidents, and maintain audit trails for compliance and forensic analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Security event logging aggregates logs from all system components
- [ ] Real-time threat detection identifies security incidents and anomalies
- [ ] Alerting system notifies administrators of critical security events
- [ ] Security dashboards provide visibility into system security posture
- [ ] Audit trails maintain immutable records for compliance requirements
- [ ] Incident response workflows automate threat containment actions
- [ ] Compliance reporting generates required security and audit reports
- [ ] Integration with external threat intelligence feeds enhances detection

## Technical Details

### Security Event Logging
- Deploy centralized logging infrastructure (ELK/EFK stack)
- Collect logs from containers, hosts, network devices, and applications
- Implement structured logging with security event taxonomy
- Set up log retention policies and secure log storage
- Configure log encryption and integrity protection

### Threat Detection Engine
- Implement behavioral analysis for anomaly detection
- Deploy signature-based detection for known threats
- Set up machine learning models for advanced threat detection
- Configure threat hunting capabilities with query-based investigation
- Implement correlation rules for multi-event threat scenarios

### Alerting and Notification
- Configure multi-channel alerting (email, Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks)
- Implement alert prioritization and escalation workflows
- Set up alert deduplication and noise reduction
- Create runbook automation for common security incidents
- Configure alert fatigue prevention with intelligent filtering

### Security Dashboards
- Build real-time security operations center (SOC) dashboards
- Create executive-level security posture reporting
- Implement threat landscape visualization and trending
- Set up compliance status dashboards and reporting
- Configure custom dashboards for different stakeholder needs

### Audit and Compliance
- Maintain immutable audit logs with cryptographic integrity
- Implement compliance reporting for various standards (SOC2, ISO27001)
- Set up data retention and archival policies
- Create forensic investigation capabilities
- Configure compliance monitoring and automated assessments

### Integration and Automation
- Integrate with workload isolation system for container security events
- Connect with authentication system for identity-related security events
- Implement automated incident response and containment actions
- Set up threat intelligence integration for enhanced detection
- Configure security orchestration and automated response (SOAR)

## Dependencies

- **Task 013**: Workload Isolation and Sandboxing - requires security events from the isolation system
- **Task 014**: Authentication and Authorization System - needs authentication and authorization security events

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (Medium - 2-3 days)**

This is a focused security monitoring task requiring:
- Configuration of logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Implementation of threat detection rules and analytics
- Setup of alerting and dashboard systems
- Integration with existing security components
- Testing of detection capabilities and alert workflows

## Definition of Done

- Security logging collects events from all critical system components
- Threat detection successfully identifies and alerts on security incidents
- Security dashboards provide clear visibility into system security status
- Audit trails capture all required events for compliance requirements
- Alerting system notifies appropriate personnel without excessive false positives
- Integration with isolation and authentication systems provides comprehensive coverage
- Automated response capabilities contain threats and minimize impact
- Compliance reporting generates accurate reports for required standards
- Security team can effectively investigate and respond to incidents
- System performance impact is minimal and within acceptable thresholds
