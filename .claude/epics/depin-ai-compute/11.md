# Task 003: IPFS Network Integration

## Description

Deploy and configure IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) nodes to provide distributed storage capabilities for the DePIN AI compute network. This includes setting up IPFS nodes for content addressing, configuring replication policies, and establishing gateway and API access for seamless integration with the compute workloads.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] IPFS nodes are deployed and connected to the network
- [ ] Content addressing and retrieval are functional
- [ ] Replication policies ensure data availability
- [ ] IPFS gateway provides HTTP access to content
- [ ] API endpoints are secured and rate-limited
- [ ] Integration with Kubernetes storage is working
- [ ] Performance metrics meet latency and throughput requirements

## Technical Details

### IPFS Node Deployment
- Deploy IPFS nodes as Kubernetes StatefulSets
- Configure cluster mode for high availability
- Set up persistent storage for IPFS data
- Configure network connectivity and peer discovery

### Content Management
- Implement content addressing for AI model storage
- Configure automatic garbage collection policies
- Set up content replication across multiple nodes
- Implement content integrity verification

### Gateway and API Setup
- Deploy IPFS HTTP gateway for web access
- Configure API endpoints with authentication
- Set up rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Implement content caching for frequently accessed data

### Kubernetes Integration
- Create CSI driver for IPFS storage integration
- Set up dynamic provisioning of IPFS volumes
- Configure pod-level access to IPFS content
- Implement content preloading for AI workloads

### Monitoring and Metrics
- Set up IPFS node health monitoring
- Configure performance metrics collection
- Implement alerting for node failures or network issues
- Set up bandwidth and storage usage tracking

## Dependencies

- **Task 001**: Requires operational Kubernetes cluster for IPFS node deployment and storage integration

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (Medium - 2-3 days)**

This task involves:
- IPFS node deployment and clustering configuration
- Gateway and API endpoint setup
- Kubernetes storage integration development
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Monitoring and alerting configuration

## Definition of Done

- IPFS nodes are operational and connected to the distributed network
- Content can be stored, addressed, and retrieved reliably
- Replication ensures data availability across multiple nodes
- HTTP gateway provides fast access to IPFS content
- API endpoints are secure and properly rate-limited
- Kubernetes storage integration allows pods to access IPFS content
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements for AI workload access
- Monitoring dashboards show node health and network metrics
- All configurations are documented and version controlled
- Integration tests demonstrate end-to-end content storage and retrieval
