# Task 019: Prometheus/Grafana Monitoring Stack Setup

## Description

Deploy and configure a comprehensive monitoring stack using Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization and dashboards. This forms the foundation of the DePIN AI compute platform's observability infrastructure, providing real-time insights into system performance, resource utilization, and operational health.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Prometheus server deployed and configured in Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Grafana instance deployed with secure authentication
- [ ] Service discovery configured for automatic metric collection
- [ ] Basic system dashboards created (CPU, memory, network, storage)
- [ ] Alerting rules configured for critical system events
- [ ] Notification channels set up (email, Slack, webhook)
- [ ] Data retention policies configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures established
- [ ] Documentation for dashboard creation and maintenance

## Technical Details

### Prometheus Configuration
- Deploy using Helm chart or Kubernetes manifests
- Configure service discovery for pods and services
- Set up scraping intervals and retention policies
- Configure storage for time-series data
- Implement security best practices

### Grafana Setup
- Deploy with persistent storage for configurations
- Configure data sources for Prometheus integration
- Set up authentication and authorization
- Create folder structure for dashboard organization
- Configure templating and variables

### Alerting Infrastructure
- Define alert rules for system metrics
- Configure alert manager for routing
- Set up notification templates
- Test alert delivery mechanisms
- Document escalation procedures

## Dependencies

- **Task 001**: Kubernetes Infrastructure Setup - Required for deployment platform
- Requires cluster admin access for monitoring namespace setup
- Network policies must allow metrics collection across namespaces

## Effort Estimate

**Medium (2-3 days)**
- Day 1: Prometheus deployment and configuration
- Day 2: Grafana setup and basic dashboards
- Day 3: Alerting configuration and testing

## Definition of Done

- Prometheus successfully collecting metrics from all cluster nodes
- Grafana dashboards displaying real-time system metrics
- Alert rules firing correctly for test conditions
- Notifications being delivered through configured channels
- All components passing health checks
- Monitoring infrastructure documented and runbook created
- Performance baselines established for future optimization
