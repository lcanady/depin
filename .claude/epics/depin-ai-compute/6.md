# Task 001: Kubernetes Cluster Setup and Configuration

## Description

Set up the foundational Kubernetes cluster infrastructure that will serve as the orchestration layer for the DePIN AI compute network. This includes configuring the base cluster with proper networking, storage, and security policies, along with installing essential operators and controllers needed for the compute workload management.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Kubernetes cluster is deployed and accessible
- [ ] Core networking components (CNI) are configured and operational
- [ ] Storage classes and persistent volume provisioners are set up
- [ ] Basic security policies and RBAC are implemented
- [ ] Essential operators (monitoring, logging, ingress) are installed
- [ ] Cluster passes basic health checks and readiness probes
- [ ] Documentation for cluster configuration is created

## Technical Details

### Cluster Configuration
- Deploy multi-node Kubernetes cluster (minimum 3 control plane nodes)
- Configure high availability for control plane components
- Set up cluster networking with appropriate CNI (Calico/Cilium recommended)
- Configure cluster DNS and service discovery

### Storage Setup
- Deploy storage provisioners for persistent volumes
- Configure storage classes for different performance tiers
- Set up backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Security Implementation
- Implement Pod Security Standards
- Configure network policies for traffic segmentation
- Set up RBAC roles and service accounts
- Enable audit logging and monitoring

### Essential Operators
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Logging aggregation (ELK/EFK stack)
- Ingress controller for external access
- Cert-manager for TLS certificate automation

## Dependencies

None - this is the foundational task that other infrastructure components depend on.

## Effort Estimate

**Size: L (Large - 3-4 days)**

This is a complex foundational task requiring:
- Infrastructure provisioning and configuration
- Security hardening and policy implementation
- Operator deployment and configuration
- Testing and validation of all components

## Definition of Done

- Kubernetes cluster is fully operational with all nodes in Ready state
- All essential operators are deployed and functioning correctly
- Security policies are implemented and enforced
- Monitoring and logging are capturing cluster metrics and events
- Storage provisioning is working for test workloads
- Cluster configuration is documented and version controlled
- Health checks pass for all critical components
- Cluster is ready to host container workloads for subsequent tasks
