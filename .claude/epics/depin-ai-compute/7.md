## Description
Build a comprehensive consumer portal that enables AI/ML researchers and developers to submit computational jobs, monitor execution progress, retrieve results, and manage billing within the DePIN AI compute marketplace. This interface serves as the primary entry point for consumers to access distributed computational resources.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Job submission interface with requirement specification forms
- [ ] Job monitoring dashboard with real-time status updates
- [ ] Results retrieval and download functionality
- [ ] Payment and billing management interface
- [ ] Resource requirement calculator and cost estimation
- [ ] Job history and analytics tracking
- [ ] File upload/download for datasets and models
- [ ] Job templates and saved configurations
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design for consumer accessibility
- [ ] Integration with job scheduler and billing APIs

## Technical Details

### Frontend Architecture
- React-based portal with TypeScript
- Form validation using Formik or React Hook Form
- File upload handling with progress indicators
- Real-time job status via WebSocket connections
- Responsive design using modern CSS framework

### Key Components
- JobSubmissionForm: Computational job specification interface
- JobMonitoringDashboard: Real-time job status and progress
- ResultsManager: Download and view job outputs
- BillingInterface: Payment methods and invoice management
- ResourceCalculator: Cost estimation and resource planning
- JobHistory: Historical job tracking and analytics

### API Integration
- POST /api/consumer/jobs - Submit new computational jobs
- GET /api/consumer/jobs/{id} - Get job status and details
- GET /api/consumer/jobs/{id}/results - Download job results
- GET /api/consumer/billing - Billing history and current charges
- POST /api/consumer/billing/payment - Process payments
- WebSocket /ws/consumer/job-updates - Real-time job status

### File Management
- Secure file upload for datasets and model files
- Progress tracking for large file transfers
- Result file download with integrity verification
- Cloud storage integration for persistent data

## Dependencies
- **Task 007**: Job scheduler and execution engine (job APIs)
- **Task 012**: Billing and invoicing system (payment processing)

## Effort Estimate
**Large (L)**: 3-4 days
- Job submission and forms: 1 day
- Monitoring and results interface: 1 day
- Billing and payment components: 1 day
- Integration and testing: 1 day

## Definition of Done
