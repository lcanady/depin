## Description
Build a comprehensive provider dashboard that enables resource providers to manage their computational resources, monitor performance, and track earnings within the DePIN AI compute marketplace. This interface serves as the primary control center for providers to configure, monitor, and optimize their resource contributions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Provider dashboard displays real-time resource utilization metrics
- [ ] Earnings tracking shows historical and current revenue data
- [ ] Resource configuration interface allows GPU/CPU specification updates
- [ ] Performance monitoring displays job completion rates and uptime
- [ ] Revenue analytics with breakdown by resource type and time periods
- [ ] Resource status management (online/offline/maintenance modes)
- [ ] Alert system for resource issues and maintenance notifications
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design for provider accessibility
- [ ] Integration with resource monitoring backend APIs
- [ ] Payment history and withdrawal interface

## Technical Details

### Frontend Architecture
- React-based dashboard with TypeScript
- Chart.js or D3.js for performance and earnings visualizations
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS or similar framework

### Key Components
- ResourceOverview: Real-time resource status and metrics
- EarningsTracker: Revenue analytics and payment history
- ResourceConfig: Hardware specification management
- PerformanceMonitor: Job completion and uptime metrics
- AlertCenter: Notifications and system alerts

### API Integration
- GET /api/provider/resources - Resource status and configuration
- GET /api/provider/earnings - Revenue and payment data
- PUT /api/provider/resources/config - Update resource specifications
- GET /api/provider/performance - Performance metrics and analytics
- WebSocket /ws/provider/updates - Real-time status updates

### State Management
- Redux or Context API for global provider state
- Real-time data synchronization with backend
- Optimistic updates for configuration changes

## Dependencies
- **Task 005**: Resource monitoring and health checks (backend APIs)
- **Task 011**: Payment processing and earnings tracking (payment data)

## Effort Estimate
**Large (L)**: 3-4 days
- Dashboard layout and navigation: 1 day
- Resource management interface: 1 day  
- Earnings and analytics components: 1 day
- Integration and testing: 1 day

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All dashboard components render correctly with real data
- [ ] Resource configuration updates persist to backend
- [ ] Earnings tracking displays accurate historical data
- [ ] Performance metrics update in real-time
- [ ] Mobile-responsive interface tested on multiple devices
- [ ] Error handling for API failures implemented
- [ ] Unit tests written for all major components
- [ ] Integration tests verify API communication
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
