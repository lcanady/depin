# Task 006: Resource Allocation and Capacity Management

## Description

Implement an intelligent resource reservation system that optimizes GPU allocation across registered providers. This system includes sophisticated capacity planning algorithms and resource utilization optimization to ensure efficient distribution of compute tasks while maximizing resource utilization and minimizing costs across the decentralized network.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Resource reservation API for compute job allocation
- [ ] Intelligent allocation algorithms considering provider capabilities
- [ ] Capacity planning system for future resource needs
- [ ] Resource utilization optimization across all providers
- [ ] Dynamic rebalancing of workloads based on performance metrics
- [ ] Cost optimization algorithms for provider selection
- [ ] Resource conflict resolution for competing allocations
- [ ] Allocation quotas and limits enforcement
- [ ] Preemption policies for priority-based scheduling
- [ ] Integration with health monitoring for allocation decisions

## Technical Details

### Components to Implement
- **Allocation Service**: Core resource reservation and scheduling engine
- **Capacity Planner**: Predictive analysis for resource demand
- **Optimization Engine**: Algorithms for efficient resource utilization
- **Scheduler**: Task assignment and workload distribution
- **Cost Calculator**: Provider pricing and cost optimization

### Key Technologies
- Advanced scheduling algorithms (bin packing, genetic algorithms)
- Machine learning for capacity prediction
- Real-time optimization engines
- Graph databases for resource relationship modeling
- Event-driven architecture for dynamic allocation

### Integration Points
- Resource registry from Task 004 for available resource pool
- Health monitoring from Task 005 for allocation decision inputs
- Provider APIs for resource reservation and release
- Cost management system for billing and optimization

## Dependencies

- **Task 004**: GPU Resource Discovery and Registration - Required for resource pool data
- **Task 005**: Resource Health Monitoring and Metrics - Required for informed allocation decisions

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: L (Large - 3-4 days)

**Breakdown**:
- Resource allocation API and core logic: 1.5 days
- Capacity planning algorithms: 1 day
- Optimization engine and scheduler: 1 day
- Cost optimization and conflict resolution: 0.5 days
