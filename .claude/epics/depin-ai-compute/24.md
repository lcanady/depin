## Description

Establish a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure automation system for the DePIN AI compute platform. This includes automated testing, deployment pipelines, infrastructure-as-code provisioning, and operational monitoring. The system must ensure reliable, secure, and scalable deployments across different environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configured
- [ ] Automated test execution on pull requests and merges
- [ ] Multi-environment deployment automation (dev, staging, production)
- [ ] Infrastructure-as-code templates (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- [ ] Container orchestration setup (Docker/Kubernetes)
- [ ] Automated security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Database migration automation
- [ ] Blue-green or canary deployment strategies
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting integration

## Technical Details

### CI/CD Pipeline Components
1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Automated test execution
   - Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency audit and updates

2. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Environment-specific deployment configs
   - Automated database migrations
   - Service health checks
   - Traffic routing and load balancing

3. **Infrastructure Automation**
   - Infrastructure-as-code templates
   - Environment provisioning scripts
   - Resource scaling automation
   - Backup and disaster recovery

### Deployment Strategy
- **Staging Environment**: Full production replica for testing
- **Production Deployment**: Blue-green or canary releases
- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic rollback on failure detection
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive service health checks

### Security Integration
- Container image scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Secrets management and rotation
- Access control and audit logging

## Dependencies

- **Task 022**: Comprehensive test suite (required for automated testing)

## Effort Estimate

**L (3-4 days)**

- Day 1: CI/CD pipeline setup and basic automation
- Day 2: Infrastructure-as-code templates and environment provisioning
- Day 3: Advanced deployment strategies and security integration
- Day 4: Monitoring, alerting, and operational procedures

## Definition of Done

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational and tested
- [ ] All environments provisioned via infrastructure-as-code
- [ ] Automated deployment process validated across environments
- [ ] Security scanning integrated and passing
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Infrastructure documentation and runbooks created
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures established and tested
