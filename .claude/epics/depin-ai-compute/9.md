# Task 007: Job Queue and Scheduling Engine

## Description

Build a comprehensive job submission and queue management system with priority-based scheduling algorithms and workload distribution logic. This forms the core orchestration layer that manages compute job lifecycle from submission to completion.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Job submission API accepts compute requests with resource specifications
- [ ] Queue management system handles job prioritization and ordering
- [ ] Priority-based scheduling algorithms distribute jobs to available compute nodes
- [ ] Workload distribution logic optimizes resource utilization across the network
- [ ] Job status tracking and monitoring throughout lifecycle
- [ ] Queue persistence and recovery mechanisms for system reliability
- [ ] Rate limiting and backpressure handling for queue stability

## Technical Details

### Job Queue System
- Implement persistent job queue with Redis/database backend
- Support job priorities (high, normal, low) and deadline scheduling
- Handle job dependencies and batch job processing
- Provide queue metrics and monitoring endpoints

### Scheduling Engine
- Implement round-robin, priority-based, and fair-share scheduling algorithms
- Support resource-aware scheduling (CPU, memory, GPU requirements)
- Handle job preemption and resource reclamation
- Provide scheduling policy configuration

### Workload Distribution
- Implement load-aware job distribution across compute nodes
- Support geographic and network topology-aware placement
- Handle node failure and job rescheduling
- Optimize for resource utilization and job completion time

## Dependencies

- **Task 002**: Container Runtime and Execution Engine (needed for job execution context)
- **Task 004**: Node Discovery and Network Mesh (needed for compute node availability)

## Effort Estimate

**XL (4-5 days)**
- Complex scheduling algorithms and queue management
- Multiple distribution strategies and optimization logic
- Comprehensive job lifecycle management
- Extensive testing for reliability and performance

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Job queue system deployed and operational
- [ ] Scheduling engine properly distributes jobs based on priorities
- [ ] Workload distribution optimizes resource utilization
- [ ] All queue operations are persistent and recoverable
- [ ] Comprehensive unit and integration tests pass
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Documentation covers API usage and scheduling policies
- [ ] System handles failure scenarios gracefully
