# Task 002: Container Runtime and Registry Setup

## Description

Configure the container runtime environment and establish a private container registry for the DePIN AI compute network. This includes setting up Docker/containerd runtime optimization, implementing a secure private registry for container images, and establishing image scanning and security policies to ensure only trusted containers run in the compute environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Container runtime is optimized for AI/ML workloads
- [ ] Private container registry is deployed and accessible
- [ ] Image scanning and vulnerability detection are operational
- [ ] Security policies for container images are enforced
- [ ] Registry authentication and authorization are configured
- [ ] Image lifecycle management policies are implemented
- [ ] Runtime performance benchmarks meet requirements

## Technical Details

### Container Runtime Configuration
- Configure containerd/Docker with GPU support for AI workloads
- Optimize runtime settings for memory and CPU intensive tasks
- Set up container resource limits and quality of service
- Configure runtime security policies (seccomp, AppArmor)

### Private Registry Setup
- Deploy Harbor or similar enterprise registry solution
- Configure high availability and backup for registry data
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates for secure access
- Implement registry replication for disaster recovery

### Image Security
- Deploy Clair/Trivy for vulnerability scanning
- Configure automated scanning on image push
- Set up policy enforcement to block vulnerable images
- Implement image signing and verification workflows

### Authentication & Authorization
- Configure OIDC/LDAP integration for user authentication
- Set up project-based access control
- Implement service account authentication for automated systems
- Configure webhook notifications for security events

## Dependencies

- **Task 001**: Requires operational Kubernetes cluster for registry deployment and container runtime configuration

## Effort Estimate

**Size: M (Medium - 2-3 days)**

This task involves:
- Container runtime optimization and configuration
- Registry deployment and security hardening
- Image scanning pipeline setup
- Authentication system integration
- Security policy implementation and testing

## Definition of Done

- Container runtime is configured and optimized for AI workloads
- Private registry is operational with SSL/TLS encryption
- Image vulnerability scanning is automated and enforced
- Authentication and authorization are working correctly
- Security policies prevent deployment of vulnerable/untrusted images
- Registry has proper backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Performance benchmarks demonstrate runtime optimization
- All configurations are documented and version controlled
- Integration tests pass for container deployment workflows
