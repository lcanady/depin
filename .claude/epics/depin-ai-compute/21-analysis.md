# Issue #21 Analysis: Resource Allocation and Capacity Management

## Parallel Work Stream Decomposition

This resource allocation task can be decomposed into 4 parallel streams that can work simultaneously on different aspects of the allocation system:

### Stream A: Resource Allocation Service & API
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `services/allocation/`, `api/allocation/`
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately, integrates with existing systems)
**Work**:
- Build resource reservation API for compute job allocation
- Implement core allocation service and scheduling engine
- Create resource conflict resolution for competing allocations
- Allocation quotas and limits enforcement system
- Integration with existing GPU discovery and health monitoring

### Stream B: Optimization Engine & Algorithms
**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Files**: `services/optimization/`, `algorithms/scheduling/`
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Work**:
- Implement intelligent allocation algorithms (bin packing, genetic algorithms)
- Build resource utilization optimization across providers
- Create cost optimization algorithms for provider selection
- Dynamic rebalancing algorithms based on performance metrics
- Machine learning models for allocation optimization

### Stream C: Capacity Planning & Prediction
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `services/capacity/`, `analytics/prediction/`
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs allocation data patterns)
**Work**:
- Build capacity planning system for future resource needs
- Implement predictive analytics for resource demand forecasting
- Create capacity trend analysis and growth planning
- Resource utilization forecasting and optimization
- Integration with metrics and health data for predictions

### Stream D: Scheduler & Workload Management
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `services/scheduler/`, `workload/management/`
**Dependencies**: Streams A & B (needs allocation service and optimization)
**Work**:
- Build task assignment and workload distribution system
- Implement preemption policies for priority-based scheduling
- Create dynamic workload rebalancing and migration
- Job placement optimization and resource matching
- Integration with job queue and execution systems

## Execution Strategy

**Phase 1 (Immediate)**:
- Stream A: Resource Allocation Service & API
- Stream B: Optimization Engine & Algorithms

**Phase 2 (After Stream A)**:
- Stream C: Capacity Planning & Prediction

**Phase 3 (After Streams A & B)**:
- Stream D: Scheduler & Workload Management

## Coordination Points

1. **Stream A → Stream C**: Capacity planning needs allocation data and patterns
2. **Streams A & B → Stream D**: Scheduler needs allocation service and optimization algorithms
3. **All Streams → Integration**: Complete resource allocation and management system
4. **Existing Systems**: Deep integration with GPU discovery (#15) and health monitoring (#18)

## Success Criteria

- All 4 streams complete their scope
- Resource allocation API fully functional with intelligent algorithms
- Capacity planning and prediction system operational
- Optimization engine delivering efficient resource utilization
- Complete scheduler with workload management capabilities
- Integration with existing GPU discovery and monitoring systems
- Performance meets scale requirements for DePIN compute marketplace
