# Task 020: Custom DePIN Metrics and Analytics Engine

## Description

Build a specialized analytics engine that captures and analyzes DePIN-specific metrics beyond standard infrastructure monitoring. This system will track network health, provider performance, resource utilization patterns, and reputation scoring to optimize the decentralized compute network's efficiency and reliability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Custom metrics collection service deployed
- [ ] DePIN-specific metric definitions implemented
- [ ] Network health monitoring dashboard created
- [ ] Provider performance tracking system operational
- [ ] Reputation scoring algorithm implemented and tested
- [ ] Historical trend analysis capabilities
- [ ] API endpoints for metrics consumption
- [ ] Integration with existing Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Automated reporting system for key stakeholders

## Technical Details

### Custom Metrics Framework
- Develop metrics collection service using Go/Python
- Define DePIN-specific metric schemas
- Implement efficient time-series storage
- Create metrics aggregation and processing pipelines
- Build real-time streaming capabilities

### Network Health Metrics
- Provider availability and uptime tracking
- Network connectivity and latency measurements
- Resource allocation efficiency metrics
- Failure rate and error tracking
- Geographic distribution analysis

### Provider Reputation System
- Performance-based scoring algorithm
- Historical reliability tracking
- Quality of service measurements
- Penalty and reward mechanisms
- Transparent scoring methodology

### Analytics Dashboard
- Real-time network status overview
- Provider performance comparisons
- Resource utilization trends
- Cost-efficiency analysis
- Predictive capacity planning

## Dependencies

- **Task 005**: Resource Monitoring and Management System - Required for resource metrics
- **Task 019**: Prometheus/Grafana Monitoring Stack - Required for metrics infrastructure
- Access to provider registration and workload execution data

## Effort Estimate

**Large (3-4 days)**
- Day 1: Metrics framework design and core service development
- Day 2: DePIN-specific metrics implementation
- Day 3: Reputation scoring system and analytics engine
- Day 4: Dashboard integration and testing

## Definition of Done

- Custom metrics service collecting DePIN-specific data
- Network health metrics visible in dedicated dashboards
- Provider reputation scores calculated and displayed
- Historical trend analysis showing meaningful insights
- API endpoints responding correctly to metrics queries
- Integration tests passing for all analytics components
- Documentation covering metric definitions and usage
- Performance benchmarks established for analytics queries
- Stakeholder reports generating automatically
