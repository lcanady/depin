# Issue #14 Analysis: Prometheus/Grafana Monitoring Stack Setup

## Parallel Work Stream Decomposition

This monitoring infrastructure task can be decomposed into 4 parallel streams that can work simultaneously on different aspects of the observability stack:

### Stream A: Prometheus Deployment & Configuration
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus/`, `config/prometheus/`
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Work**:
- Deploy Prometheus server using Helm charts or K8s manifests
- Configure service discovery for automatic pod/service detection
- Set up scraping intervals and retention policies
- Configure persistent storage for time-series data
- Implement security best practices and authentication
- Basic server validation and health checks

### Stream B: Grafana Setup & Dashboards
**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Files**: `infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/`, `dashboards/grafana/`
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Work**:
- Deploy Grafana instance with persistent storage
- Configure authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Set up data source connections to Prometheus
- Create folder structure for dashboard organization
- Build basic system dashboards (CPU, memory, network, storage)
- Configure templating and dashboard variables

### Stream C: Alerting Infrastructure
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `infrastructure/monitoring/alerting/`, `config/alertmanager/`
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs Prometheus metrics)
**Work**:
- Deploy AlertManager for alert routing and management
- Define alert rules for critical system metrics
- Configure notification channels (email, Slack, webhook)
- Set up alert templates and message formatting
- Test alert delivery mechanisms and escalation
- Document alerting procedures and runbooks

### Stream D: Documentation & Maintenance
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: `docs/monitoring/`, `scripts/maintenance/`
**Dependencies**: Streams A, B, C (needs working stack)
**Work**:
- Create backup and recovery procedures for configurations
- Establish performance baselines and capacity planning
- Write operational runbooks for common tasks
- Document dashboard creation and customization procedures
- Create maintenance scripts for data cleanup and health checks
- Build troubleshooting guides and best practices

## Execution Strategy

**Phase 1 (Immediate)**:
- Stream A: Prometheus Deployment & Configuration
- Stream B: Grafana Setup & Dashboards

**Phase 2 (After Stream A)**:
- Stream C: Alerting Infrastructure

**Phase 3 (After Streams A, B, C)**:
- Stream D: Documentation & Maintenance

## Coordination Points

1. **Stream A → Stream C**: AlertManager needs Prometheus metrics for alert rules
2. **Stream B → Stream C**: Grafana dashboards can inform alert thresholds
3. **Streams A, B, C → Stream D**: Documentation requires working monitoring stack
4. **All Streams → Integration**: End-to-end monitoring and alerting validation

## Success Criteria

- All 4 streams complete their scope
- Prometheus successfully collecting metrics from all cluster nodes
- Grafana dashboards displaying real-time system metrics
- Alert rules firing correctly for test conditions
- Notifications being delivered through configured channels
- All components passing health checks
- Performance baselines established for future optimization
- Complete documentation and runbooks available
