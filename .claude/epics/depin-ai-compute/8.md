## Description
Implement a comprehensive Web3 wallet integration and authentication interface that enables users to connect their crypto wallets, manage tokens, view transaction history, and authenticate securely within the DePIN AI compute marketplace. This interface bridges traditional web authentication with blockchain-based identity management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-wallet connection support (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet)
- [ ] Wallet authentication and signature verification
- [ ] Token balance display and management interface
- [ ] Transaction history and status tracking
- [ ] Profile management with wallet-based identity
- [ ] Secure session management with wallet signatures
- [ ] Token approval and spending limit management
- [ ] Network switching and multi-chain support
- [ ] Mobile wallet integration via WalletConnect
- [ ] Fallback authentication for users without wallets

## Technical Details

### Frontend Architecture
- Web3 integration using ethers.js or wagmi
- Wallet connection modal with provider detection
- React context for wallet state management
- TypeScript interfaces for wallet interactions
- Responsive design for mobile wallet apps

### Key Components
- WalletConnector: Multi-wallet connection interface
- AuthenticationManager: Signature-based login system
- TokenManager: Balance display and transaction interface
- TransactionHistory: Historical transaction tracking
- ProfileManager: User profile and settings
- NetworkSwitcher: Chain selection and management

### Web3 Integration
- Wallet provider detection and connection
- Message signing for authentication
- Token contract interactions (ERC-20/ERC-721)
- Transaction broadcasting and monitoring
- Gas estimation and fee management
- Event listening for real-time updates

### Authentication Flow
1. Wallet connection and provider detection
2. Challenge message generation and signing
3. Signature verification via backend API
4. JWT token generation and session management
5. Automatic re-authentication on page refresh

### Supported Wallets
- MetaMask (browser extension and mobile)
- WalletConnect (mobile wallet bridge)
- Coinbase Wallet
- Rainbow Wallet
- Trust Wallet
- Generic WalletConnect compatible wallets

## Dependencies
- **Task 014**: Authentication and authorization system (backend APIs)

## Effort Estimate
**Medium (M)**: 2-3 days
- Wallet connection and detection: 1 day
- Authentication and session management: 1 day
- Token management and UI polish: 1 day

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All major wallet providers connect successfully
- [ ] Wallet authentication generates valid JWT tokens
- [ ] Token balances display correctly for connected wallet
- [ ] Transaction history shows accurate blockchain data
- [ ] Profile management persists user preferences
- [ ] Network switching works across supported chains
- [ ] Mobile wallet integration via WalletConnect functional
- [ ] Error handling for wallet connection failures
- [ ] Fallback authentication available for non-Web3 users
- [ ] Session management handles wallet disconnection gracefully
- [ ] Unit tests written for wallet interaction logic
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end authentication flow
- [ ] Security audit completed for signature verification
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
