# Epic: DePIN AI Compute Marketplace

## Overview
Build a decentralized marketplace that connects AI compute demand with distributed GPU resources through blockchain incentives. The platform will enable resource providers to monetize idle GPUs while offering cost-effective AI compute access to developers and enterprises.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum-compatible network for token operations and smart contracts
- **Containerization**: Docker/Kubernetes for secure workload isolation
- **API Architecture**: RESTful microservices with GraphQL for complex queries
- **Authentication**: JWT with Web3 wallet integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for core data, Redis for caching, IPFS for distributed storage
- **Orchestration**: Custom scheduler with Kubernetes as underlying runtime
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana stack with custom DePIN metrics

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Provider Dashboard**: Resource management, earnings, and performance metrics
- **Consumer Portal**: Job submission, monitoring, and payment interface
- **Admin Panel**: Network oversight, dispute resolution, and system health
- **Public Marketplace**: Resource discovery and provider reputation system
- **Web3 Integration**: Wallet connection, token management, and transaction handling

### Backend Services
- **Orchestrator Service**: Job scheduling, resource matching, and load balancing
- **Resource Manager**: Provider registration, capability verification, and health monitoring
- **Payment Engine**: Token transactions, escrow management, and fee distribution
- **Security Service**: Workload validation, threat detection, and access control
- **Analytics Engine**: Performance metrics, usage tracking, and reputation scoring

### Infrastructure
- **Container Runtime**: Kubernetes cluster for workload execution
- **Blockchain Integration**: Smart contracts for payments and governance
- **Monitoring Stack**: Real-time metrics, alerting, and performance tracking
- **Content Delivery**: IPFS for model distribution and result storage
- **Load Balancing**: Geographic distribution and failover mechanisms

## Implementation Strategy
1. **MVP Foundation**: Core marketplace with basic GPU resource pooling
2. **Security Hardening**: Comprehensive isolation and threat protection
3. **Token Economics**: Incentive mechanisms and payment systems
4. **Scale Optimization**: Performance tuning and network growth features
5. **Enterprise Features**: SLAs, advanced analytics, and compliance tools

## Task Breakdown Preview
